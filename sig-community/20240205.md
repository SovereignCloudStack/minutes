## Agenda

### Community Pages Rework

* Collect ideas from SIG Community
    * Feedback from outside: what is expected, what would be interesting
    * Specific persons and (maybe) groups/SIGs as well
    * different targets: people from tenders (and SCS community) and "outside" people
    * mostly events were planned here
    * lots of other meetings happening
    * send out Agenda beforehand so people can decide if they're interested and have something to "add" to the topics
    + community-playbook

### Community Playbook Structure

            + Overview
            + Mission Statement (incl. Values and CoC)
            + Collaboration (index with calendar, think of redirect for https://docs.scs.community/community/calendar)
                + individual SIG / Teams Pages
            + Tools
                + Github
                    + DCO
                    + ...
                + Matrix
                + Jitsi
                + Nextcloud
                + Zuul
                + Mailing list
            + Contribute to Docs

* Needs other places
    * License Considerations <- move to adrs? discuss at SIG Standardization
    * Cloud Resources <- move to the docs, right place to be found. Discuss at SIG Documentation

* Change "Developer" to "Contributor" in the same branch / PR
* Team/SIG pages can serve for more meta data and information for SIGs and teams to elaborate
* AI: @maxwolfs will do this refactor
