#### Sport 2023
* we start in teams (3-4 persons)
* sport with SCS as a sponsored event and SCS donates the money to a project, initiative, ...
* poll about projects/initiatives to sponsor
* early or mid of September
* sport: running, walking/hiking, cycling, swimming

* get a team:
    * every attendee signs up in a list and vote for their prefered sport (multiple mentions are possible) - via (https://scs.sovereignit.de/nextcloud/apps/forms/tBpJLwaArj4eRHpt) 
    * SIG Community triggers the teams depending on the mentioned sports (every sport will be represented in every team)
    * all team mates get a mail to introduce their team and the sport to complete 

* rules for the event:
    * in week cw 36/37: 9. - 15.09.2023 every attendee complete their sport and tries to run/walk/cycle/swim as long as he/she is able to (no minimum requirement) in one track at one day (at least only one track at one day is measured for the final result, attendees could try on every day to beat their own distance)
    * every attendee report their best result, all results of a team are collected to get the final team result
    * the team with the most kilometers wins
    * we will find a compensation for cycling in mountains areas
    * no e-bikes, no virtual cycling/running 

* every kilometer counts
    * the event is a sponsored/donation event
    * sponsors pay a little sum for every x, x =
        * 5 km running
        * 20 km walking/hiking
        * 30 km cycling
        * 1 km swimming
        * (these numbers can be collected, so if one attendee runs 4 km, another 11 km, the sum will be 15 = 3x, for example)
        * running/hiking: 1, schwimming: 6, cycling: 0.25 
    * sponsors pay a bigger sum for the kilometers of a team
