### Update Holopin & Community Member Profiles

### Revisting the minutes workflow
* Is the minutes workflow OK for everyone or should be see about improving that?
* Etherpad or is there anything better (hedgedoc maybe)
	- https://docs.hedgedoc.org/setup/docker/
* Let's give HedgeDoc a try and install the Docker container on cologne.scs.community (available under input.scs.community)
* Ask whether OSBA wants to also host a dedicated HedgeDoc instance
	
### Proposal to introduce Homer by @tibeer vs. Docusaurus
* Do not host yet another tool, so let's stick with Docusarus
* The goal is to have every tool on a single dashboard / page

### Community Playbook
* proposal of TOC for community: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/265
* Matching PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/5
	* Review: @ra-beer, @garloff, @maxwolfs

### AOB
#### Jitsi vs. OpenTalk
* If OSBA (or any other entitiy) decides to host an OpenTalk instance, and turns out to work in a great way, we are happy to switch to any other VC solution
* Maybe intgegrate a coturn instance to allow bypassing of firewalls
