	* Base permission in GitHub is now set to `read`
	* Who has Maintain rights for managing issues/PR/etc?
		* Users need Maintain rights to edit issues. Who shall receive these rights?
		* Create "triage" group that can manage issues (move to doing, add labels, assign issues, etc.)
			* Always keep in sync with product owners of the respective teams
			* Add this group to all repositories
		* Create "write" group with members that we trust
			* Do we add this group only to issues or further repositories
		* Create "maintain" group with members that we trust
		* Continue to use github-permissions:
			* Upgrade submodule
			* Add GitHub Action workflow
				* Eduard will add GitHub PAT to secrets (Beware! Only Eduard will be able to merge PR)
				* Idea: Add a GitHub Action matrix and try all present GitHub Secrets (AI: Eduard will create a story for this)

				* Eduard will add all teams to orgs/SovereignCloudStack/teams/members.yml
				* Eduard will maintain orgs/SovereignCloudStack/repositories/
		* Eduard will create a issue to bring manage.py upstream to OTC repo
		* Publish a blog post and inform our org owners to only (!) use github-permission 
* security maintainance (discuss during next SIG meeting)
* AOB
	* Don't create a publication & communication schedule, simply release postings as they appear (ideally prior to the community digest to have most impact)
