### Agenda
#### Docs pages - playbook - 
* https://docs.scs.community/community/
* planed: to re-write the docs page
    * We lack a central introduction, reading-guide, overview, ...
        * Want to have a tech writer to contribute this
* https://github.com/tibeer/helm-charts/tree/gh-pages/scs-startpage
    * Access to tools: Github, jitsi, matrix, ...
* Structure from https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/265
    * WHY SCS is missing. Vision, Mission, Strategy. SCS charta may help to explain. SCS graphics shall illustrate documentation and welcome to the page
* docs.scs.community very unemotional (no pictures, just text)
    * Good as "docs" page - factual information collection
    * Not the community feel-good space
    * ... but we want to look interesting to newcomers and keep them attracted
    * architectural picture as navigation tool?
    * emotional items (mascots, swag, stickers, ...) could be helpful
        * cuddly toys/pics/logos wanted
        * Sovereign Cat Stack
