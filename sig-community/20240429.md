### Agenda

#### tech list for self subscription

Felix suggested that we make the scs-tech@lists.scs.community mailing list publicly visible and allow people to subscribe via self-service.
(We would still have to approve it individually, but we could do this for all non-spam accounts, as we have done with announce@ so far)

So far the way is different: Everyone who wanted to be on this list got an account on UCS Nextcloud (https://scs.sovereignit.de/) and was added to the SCS Technology group. The rest is done by a script (ucs2mailman3), which synchronizes this.

* subscription should be easy - self subscription should be implemented
