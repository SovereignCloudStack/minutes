## Agenda

### Proposal for new GitHub Labels
* Add labels to issues/PR for the corresponding tender lots.
* @itrich to create a PR against github-manager
* Explain during Thursday community call about these new labels

### Community Hackathon 2023
* Privacy
	* Make visitors aware of having to leave their personal data during check-in as entering a datacenter may require compliance
	* Make visitors aware of photos/videos being made and add possibility to check-out (@aeroflydesign will propose a draft text, @itrich will amend and answer the relevant questions)
	* Proposal: Add a "no-camera" icon to the visitor badge
	* Add check boxes and explaning text to the event micropage
	* Publish photos and videos in a safe space before going live
	* @aeroflydesign: Form for the use of photos. For this there will be another mail, which asks specifically where the data will be used and stored, as well as who the contact persons are.
* Slogan
	* Short, pregnant sentence
	* Maybe a pun with 2023/23
* Graphic works
	* Add date and location to banner
	* Something relative to the teaser video
	* @itrich to send details (size, usage, etc.) to @aeorflydesign
* Invitation and blog post
	* Render new teaser video with https://events.scs.community/hackathon-2023/ as URL (QR CODE)
	* Set 2023-01-26 as target date for joint advertisment
	* Give some hotel recommendations (@cedegi will look for some good hotels, i.e. MotelOne at main station)
	* Draft a brief agenda (datacenter tour, pre-social-event, working slots)
