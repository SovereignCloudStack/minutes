##### Community Pages

input still missing:
https://input.scs.community/2023-sig-community-section?both

Proposal: which content should be covered at the community pages? which could be shifted to another section?

##### Structure Dev pages and Community pages
* Developers vs. Contributors? 
    * Are the people who develop SCS further developer or contributor? 
    * In SCS the upstream community is maybe more contributors? -> better contributor
    * Community pages are for information, communication, meeting, organizational stuff, all technical content should be shifted into the contributor´s section

##### Recap: Hackathon, Sport, Community Pages

    * communicated program, clear time table, better team finding structures
