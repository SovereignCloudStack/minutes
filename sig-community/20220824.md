	* @matfechner

## Agenda:

* Mass migration master -> main
  * Needs communication, seems to work well so far

* Pair programming to work on github-manager
* github-manager
  * does not appear to be battle-proven *in the way we want to leverage it*
  * bugs/missing features *looked at by @tibeer*
    * [ansible-collection-gitcontrol issue 24](https://github.com/opentelekomcloud-infra/gitstyring/issues/24)
    * [ansible-collection-gitcontrol issue 26](https://github.com/opentelekomcloud-infra/gitstyring/issues/26)
    * [ansible-collection-gitcontrol issue 31](https://github.com/opentelekomcloud/ansible-collection-gitcontrol/issues/31) 
    * [ansible-collection-gitcontrol issue 32](https://github.com/opentelekomcloud/ansible-collection-gitcontrol/issues/32) 
    * [ansible-collection-gitcontrol issue 34](https://github.com/opentelekomcloud/ansible-collection-gitcontrol/issues/34)
  * Two repositories, oops! opentelekomcloud-infra/gistyring vs. opentelekomcloud/ansible-collection-gitcontrol ...

* Ongoing: sort people into teams to provide rights
  * Currently, only owners can do merges
  * Goal is to have a triage group that can do this as well
  * we want to encourage participation
    -> be responsive to issues & PRs!
    -> Idea: BOT that adds a comment to issues/PRs for first-time participants that provides some hints and pointers and welcomes people
       * Trouble: This can easily get stale
       * Trouble: Too much unrelated info in a comment history of an issue/PR may be negative
       * Idea: Provide mostly a link to a doc (that is being kept up-to-date)
       * Idea: Have this as part of [the template](https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/new/choose) 

* Reschedule SIG community?
  -> @Itrich: Make a new poll
