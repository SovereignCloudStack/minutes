### Agenda

0. Discussion about how to calendar
1. Quick recap of last session
2. Collaboration platform

### Collaboration platform

- WebRTC is not possible for StackIT atm, hence Jitsi+BBB (plusserver) doesn't work effectively for collaboration.
- Switching to teams to accommodate STACKITs terrible proxy thing.
-> Marvin will create a Teams Calendar Link that we're going to document in the calendar repo
- Using excalidraw
-> https://excalidraw.com/#room=8f5e70a4f420733dd0c7,KKQB-IM3tGt5soWk4LFStw is accessible for StackIT and the rest

### Ralf onboarding people

- introduced the github-manager repo to Marvin to increase collaboration

### Next-Steps

- create a mind map/brainstorming so it can be clustered and billing work stream requirements can be identified
