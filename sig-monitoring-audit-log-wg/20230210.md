### Agenda

1. Discuss integration of Audit Logging with Metering
2. Define boundaries of Audit Logging infrastructure in SCS

#### Discuss integration of audit logging with metering

- "Can we bolt this onto the Metering?" The approaches could be similar: pull events out of rabbitmq, filter, and push them somewhere in $realtime, reconcile with stuff.
- Connect with the OpenStack Telemetry project to understand potential overlap

#### Define boundaries of Audit Logging infrastructure in SCS

##### Quick recap of the Metering design

* Use gnocchi + ceilometer
    * Gnocchi may not suitable for audit events as it's a TSDB
* Consumption-API -> various Services send CRUD events to consumption API in order for them to be aggregated
* We'll use $ConsumptionAPI as a placeholder for a receiving end for CRUD events.

##### Audit Logging discussion

* Quick detour to explain SIEM (Security Information Event Management)
* From that follows that the audit logging thing needs to be able to plug into existing solutions
* Push based to ensure real-time-ity and easy translation to such systems
  * for instance with fluentd wire protocol
  * what to do if blocked? (metering can re-generate from gnocchi...)

(Unique events vs. re-sending unique events in case of errors
how does one re-create unique events that where not send due to errors => not relevant for now for the audit logging, however tese types of events eist for audit logging as well)

* If we start with audit logging, it should assure that it is a viable component to achieve BSI C5.

Outcome of today:
    
a) Push over Pull, ring buffer
b) What is done if buffer full (back preasure -> rabbitmq?)
c) Is logging a blocking operation or not?
