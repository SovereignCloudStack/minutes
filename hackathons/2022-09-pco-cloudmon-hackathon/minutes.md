## Howto for the day

Please arrive by 10am. @frosty-geek organized a room at the co working space.
We'll get settled and have a first chance of getting to know us in person a bit.

For the day, we want to get a good booster started so that in the following sprint at Plusserver (which goes for three weeks starting on the 22nd of September) a MVP that monitors the PCO can be build.

The idea for the day is not to have drilled down agenda, but instead see that we lay out good starting points.
Artem from OTC (the brain behind ApiMon/CloudMon) is joining and can give proper clues on where and how to start from the initial POC we did during the SCS Hacksessions.

An important part is the documentation of CloudMon and its architecture, since this will help to get more collaborators on board down the road. @fkr would like to get a good start on that during the day in order to be able to nuture this further from the SCS side.
