## Agenda

### Status Page

There have been two MVPs and along those we discovered a few possibilities. Both MVPs explored different aspects, with the learning from that we should now discuss how to move forward.
* Exploration done, now ready to design a v1 architecture
* Nice diagrams available
* Should record this in an architecture decision record (ADR)

Joshua taking us through the architecture of MVPs ...
* Two APIs, one public (anonymous, read-only) one, one (authenticated) for the admin that pushes status ...
* OAuth2 web authentication flow for admin -> access_token
* Goal is to keep fine-grained role model out of API server
  - May add a policy engine later, preferably external to API server

Discussion:
* Authorization: 
  - Reverse proxy may do tenant separation (e.g. have header with tenant info that is observed by API server)
  - Status page may be external and we may not want to depend on standard IAM system for it
  - Should thus keep auth for status page really lightweight (e.g. flat file)
* Avoid making it too complex and flexible, avoid (2nd System Effect)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect]
* OpenAPI spec (only READ in v1): https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/status-page-openapi
  - Create, Update, Delete still missing
* Architecture (standard) should not require HA setups
  - Various storage/persistence backends possible: DB, filesystem, git repo
* Keep reference implementation simple and minimal!

Status Page layers of consensus (@joshmue):
1. Resource definition (e.g. what is an incident? what is a component? what attributes and states?) and REST API
2. General architecture  and Authentication and authorization mechanisms to talk service
3. Implementation of core components
4. Choice of further components and deployment automation
