  https://zuul.scs.community/t/SCS/builds?job_name=k8s-cluster-api-provider-e2e-conformance&project=SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider
  -> Broken for very long time, contacted Jan about repairing or removing the job
  - ERROR: The K8s cluster version 1.28.8 of cluster 'main-be9873f-admin@main-be9873f' is outdated according to the standard.
  - AI @matofeder will inform VP06c team to resolve this one - asap
- Project: SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline
  https://zuul.scs.community/t/SCS/builds?job_name=scs-daily-security-scan&project=SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline
  -> Broken for 3 days now

### IaaS monitoring - report (@matofeder)

- IaaS Monitoring support in the SCS monitoring platform
    - Idea - extend the SCS monitoring platform with IaaS (OpenStack) Prometheus exporters and Grafana dashboards
    - The first iteration has been done:
        - Integration of OpenStack exporter and new [dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/21085-openstack-overview/)
        - Try it! - read the [docs](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/blob/main/docs/iaas.md)
    - Ongoing:
        - Port the above IaaS monitoring support into OSISM (https://github.com/osism/ansible-collection-services/pull/1434)
    - Idea is to integrate this also in yaook
        - has been discussed with the yaook folks on #yaook on irc.oftc.net
        - wohooo

### Central API - report (@joshmue)

- Access established...
    - ...to Plusserver Gardener
    - ...to Regio Gardener
- Will create XRD with Gardener Composite

### Statuspage (@joshuai96)

- No news for web frontend as @snkaupe is on vacation
- No AI for `status-page-api` in MVP3 
- Seize the moment to implement metrics and monitoring
    - Monitoring in deployment 
        - Dex and Oauthkeeper already supply metric endpoint
        - `status-page-api` could implement [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)
            - [autoinstrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation/github.com/labstack/echo). Thanks @matofeder and @artificial-intelligence
            - include in SCS Grafana/Prometheus @matofeder
