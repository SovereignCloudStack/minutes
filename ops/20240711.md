## Agenda

### Housekeeping (@bitkeks)

- Any open standards PRs to discuss?
- Ops board
    - [Ops Board for Ops, Status Page and VP12](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/8?layout=table&groupedBy%5BcolumnId%5D=Status&filterQuery=label%3A%22ops%22%2C%22status-page%22%2C%22SCS-VP12%22+-status%3ADone%2CAbandoned+&visibleFields=%5B%22Title%22%2C%22Assignees%22%2C%22Labels%22%2C%22Repository%22%5D)
    - Check: stale issues, unassigned Doings


### Tech previews (was: MVPs)

- Status Page and Central API artifacts in July
- Term "MVPs" might be confusing, since we are talking about deliverables for the R7 release. Are therefore now called "tech previews"
- Status Page: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/673
- Central API: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/674

### Status page

### Zuul

There was a Zuul 11 release because of a security issue. Probably worth to check if an upgrade of SCS Zuul is required: https://lists.zuul-ci.org/archives/list/zuul-announce@lists.zuul-ci.org/message/Z3XLI6OA6EY4KC45QSDVYTRE7CRQBICY/
 
A vulnerability was discovered which could potentially allow jobs with a malicious cleanup-run playbook to access the credentials of their parents or the nodepool ssh key. 

### Central API

- Release of first tech preview MVP is waiting for SCS lab - blocker? No
- Was already deployed in gx-scs (cluster stacks) and regio (gardener)
- Current: container images are built locally by Joshua and pushed to Harbor
    - Is there a problem with Zuul pushing built images to Harbor registry?
    - Clear up how to use this workflow
- Scope
    - Workflow like in hackathon
    - Authentication of customers against SCS Keycloak? Not tested yet, can be explored
