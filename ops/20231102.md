## Agenda

### Mandate a specific prefix for Zuul secrets?

- see [this comment](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/96#discussion_r1367451081)
- secret names must be unique across all projects
- @berendt proposes to mandate a prefix `SECRET_REPO` (where REPO is to be substituted)
- @berendt explained in depth how this works
    - "makes a lot of sense" @fkr
- needs to be documented
    - https://docs.scs.community/dev-docs/operations/operations/zuul-ci-cd-quickstart-user-guide
    - _AI @berendt: will add it there_ 
        - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/461

### Zuul, recent issues

- Works not reliable, we are investigating this
    - Two times there were network issues on WaveStack that we needed to reattach the Public IP to the VM
    - Need further debugging on dying containers
    - How do we recognize that Zuul is not working? Do we generally notice and tackle problems in the Zuul context quickly enough?
- @fkr proposes to move zuul away from Wavestack
    - gx-scs 
    - _AI @fkr: create proper issue for that for moving and assign to team gonicus_
