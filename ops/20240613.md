### Status Page Development Update (@snkaupe & @joshuai96)

- Status Page Observability Data
    - <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/653>
    - Metrics from components: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/654
        - Dex seems to only supply Go runtime metrics
        - Oathkeeper request histogram metrics are broken
        - Postgres exporter is up and running fine
        - Local Prometheus and Grafana are set up to help visualize data (KinD deployment)
    - Next up: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/655
    - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/656 blocked until all data is supplied
- Not related: "Export and import of data via api call", https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/592
- Work on Frontend: no (visible) updates, more work on page internals
    - UI designs planned for next weeks (incident feature)
    - "Future incidents"/Scheduled Maintenance Events not part of this MVP, to be planned after
    - No fixed date for MVP -> @fkr


### Zuul Keeper (@scoopex)

- Project: SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider still fails
  <https://zuul.scs.community/t/SCS/builds?job_name=k8s-cluster-api-provider-e2e-conformance&project=SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider>
  -  Any news from the container team? @matofeder?
  -  Fixes were implemented, but might still need some work from container team
- General idea: use the newly deployed "s" flavour in gx-scs in jobs
- Topic will partly be taken into container call to resolve the question of doing work on CaaS v1 related pipelines (Roman, Marc)


### Zuul (@o-otte)

- Want to add Zuul Job for SCS Contributors to easily built container images and push them to SCS Harbor [issues#518](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/518)
    - Ops tools can be used as container image examples: Status Page and API, [zuul mqtt matrix bridge](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/zuul-mqtt-matrix-bridge/tree/main/docker)
    - After results, @o-otte will document and present the new feature for community
    - Security scanning, SBOMs later additional features (Trivy is already deployed in Harbor)
        - https://goharbor.io/docs/edge/administration/sbom-integration/
        - [Harbor 2.11 Release](https://goharbor.io/blog/harbor-2.11/) from June 2024 brings SBOM generation
    - We focus on completing the workflow "Code to Github -> Zuul builds -> Zuul builds container -> Zuul pushes to registry.scs" to get the container image build pipeline on the street. All registry-tooling can be added afterwards
- OIDC Admin Login for Zuul Webinterface [issues#432](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/432)
    - Would make administration easier
        - Currently, it is needed to exec into the executor container to obtain a token for the Zuul Client CLI
        - Administation should be possible with the Web UI if OIDC is configured
    - Needs a GitHub Group with GitHub Application
        - @o-otte creates PR in github-manager
    - What should be the Zuul IdP? Github or Keycloak?
        - Opinion 1: Use planned SCS Keycloak instance for testing the OIDC connection, and maybe federation with Github
        - Opinion 2: Use Github OIDC directly, as in other tools already done
        - Decision: We continue with Github to progress faster, Zuul is a critical component and should not be blocked by testing
        - Keycloak is not prod-ready yet, can be later tested with the dev-zuul
