### Observability in IaaS and KaaS (@matofeder, @bitkeks)

- What about RC-readiness of IaaS observability?
    - OSISM testbed monitoring
        - dNation monitoring part:
            - It is possible to enable testbed monitoring in the dNation monitoring as a tech preview feature, see [here](https://github.com/dNationCloud/kubernetes-monitoring/blob/main/chart/values.yaml#L90)
            - Testbed-specific dashboards
        - OSISM testbed part:
            - 3 out of 4 related PRs have been merged in OSISM repositories
                - merged: [#337](https://github.com/osism/ansible-playbooks/pull/337), [#1221](https://github.com/osism/ansible-collection-services/pull/1221), [#385](https://github.com/osism/cfg-generics/pull/385)
                - under review [#1855](https://github.com/osism/testbed/pull/1855)
                
- What's new in the observability cluster stack?
    - Code developed within SCS project has been ported to the upstream repositories
        - dnation-monitoring-stack (monitoring infra.) v3.4.5-> v3.5.0 [#98](https://github.com/dNationCloud/kubernetes-monitoring-stack/pull/98)
        - dnation-monitoring (dashboards + alerts) v2.6.3 -> v2.7.0 [#197](https://github.com/dNationCloud/kubernetes-monitoring/pull/197)
    - As a result of the above, installation steps (readme) in the `scs/k8s-observability` repository have been adjusted and simplified [#42](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/pull/42)
    - In progress (@matofeder): refactor the scs/k8s-observability documentation further and add this OPS component to the docs.scs.community overview map [#136](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/issues/136) 

### Zuul dev instance (@PixelPhantomX, @o-otte)

- Work completed, using OSISM role
- Current work regarding local role to adapt SCS-specific config (like in SCS-Zuul)
- Next improvement: stabilize persistence (Zookeeper and MySQL)
- Can the Zuul dev instance be reproduced easily? -> Should be possible

### Downtime and migration notice from PS

- PlusServer will migrate the servers for SCS Zuul before R6
- No fixed timeline yet
- Need to Setup Zuul in the (new) migrated environment
    - Need a backup and restore of Zookeeper and the MySQL for the Zuul migration

### Status Page (@snkaupe, @joshmue)

- Status about the frontend development (Incident rendering)
    - Started on the work of rendering of content
    - Local problems with CORS, might not occur on the deployment setup
    - First rendering of the default view is partly done
- Connection to Status API?
    - Currently blocked by the CORS problem for local development, have a workaround
    - https://blog.meain.io/2024/just-enough-cors/
    - Workaround simulates the working connection with the correct data format
- Status about the deployment
    - Still waiting on @garloff regarding the DNS records [issues#511](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/511)
    - Deployment ready for a local KinD cluster. Needs only a few adjustments for a productive cluster
