        - Nice Grafana dashboards have been deployed to the [SCS Observer](https://monitoring.scs.community/d/f4f21991b06d8e5f6308eb2b590a4cee/host-monitoring-zuul)
    - Implementation finished and complete, as discussed in last meeting

#### Dev instance for Zuul (@PixelPhantomX, @o-otte)

### Central API (@joshmue)

- Anything to report from this week's [SIG meeting](https://input.scs.community/2024-scs-sig-central-api?view#2024-01-30):
    - [PR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/central-api/pull/3) can be approved and merged
    - Discussed how a deployment can be made and discussed if the Central API can be included in R6.

### Observability (@matofeder)

- Topic scheduled for this week - what's new?
    - Prometheus Alertmanager has been configured to send alerts to the dedicated Matrix chat room: [SCS | Monitoring Reports](https://matrix.to/#/#scs-monitoring-reports:matrix.org)
        - find details/configuration [here](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/tree/main/matrix-alertmanager)
    - Prometheus Alertmanager UI, as well as the Thanos Query UI are accessible via SCS org. GitHub OAuth
        - find details/configuration [here](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/tree/main/oauth)
        - URLs:
            - https://monitoring.scs.community/thanos
            - https://monitoring.scs.community/alertmanager
    - SCS lab monitoring?
        - If we can deploy the [Prometheus Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) into the SCS lab component(s) and access exporter endpoint via internet, it could be a low-hanging fruit
        - Ansible role for deployment available?
            - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/zuul/tree/prepare_gx-scs_deployment/ansible/roles to be merged with [PR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/zuul/pull/10)
                - Should streamline the Ansible Roles with the OSISM roles for Node Exporter and cAdvisor
                - First source: OSISM Ansible, second: self-built (Zuul)
                - Prevent duplicate roles, check:
                    1. cadvisor: use existing OSISM role in gx-scs_deployment
                    2. node-exporter: use existing OSISM role in gx-scs_deployment
                    3. statsd-exporter: self-built, needs PR to OSISM
        - @scoopex looks for ways to scrape:
            - Sonic switches
            - Hardware BMC statistics
            - Ceph Metrics
        - Links

### Status Page (@joshmue)

- Status about the deployment
    - @joshmue got access, no further progress yet
- Status about the frontend development
    - TBD next week

### SCS lab aka VP18 (@scoopex)

- The construction of VP18 is taking a long time as the hardware delivery could only be completed at monday (2024-01-29)
- The automation of the configuration and provisioning of the hardware nodes was completed last week
- The config repo is currently being set up with the configuration of the system. I am in the process of improving the technical and documentation aspects of the creation process.
- We are also currently in the process of procuring GPU cards. However, the procurement processes for public sector projects and the potential suppliers are taking a long time.
- Readyness forecast: SCS lab ready in the next weeks, most blockers WIP or resolved
- Feedback for setup and suggestions for topics are very welcome.
