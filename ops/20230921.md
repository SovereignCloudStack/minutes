## Agenda

### A few words on R5

* Status Page Release will be held separately of the SCS R5 release

### Sprint Review Kyoto & Sprint Planning Ljubljana

#### Technical Preview Status Page API Server & Deployment

* Access to the Cluster on which also Harbor is running is working
* Currently working on Status Page API Access rules
* After those rules are tested locally it will be deployed on the Kubernetes cluster
* Idea to be tested with the [Cluster Stacks Demo](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks-demo)
    * To create a workload cluster with Cluster Stacks and use it for the Status Page
    * To test Cluster Stacks locally
    * needs a session with Syself
* Question on using Keycloak instead of GitHub IdP
    * Multiple connectors possible
    * Keycloak should be possible with some config changes
    * Which Keycloak to use for tests? Maybe IAM Testbed Keycloak? Would be better and more efficient than to provision a new Keycloak
        * Use IAM Testbed Keycloak

#### Central API

* Authetication was built using the IAM Testbed, issues#373.
* Waiting on OSISM on how keycloak federation is working (https://docs.scs.community/docs/iaas/deployment-examples/testbed/doc/federation and https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/pull/728)
* Next task would be onboarding of users as other issues are blocked or done.
* OpenStack Management is done
* Kubernetes managed, Cluster Stacks will be investigated

#### Observability

* @o-otte discussed this in SIG Monitoring
    * Auto-discovery of newly created customer clusters needed
    * AI _@fkr: Send out invitation to SIG Monitoring next friday_
    * AI _@o-otte: Move SIG Monitoring to 13:05 and inform teams_

#### Zuul for SCS

* @o-otte and @master-caster synced on the issues of Zuul
* New [Epic](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/428) for enhancements of the SCS Zuul Deployment
