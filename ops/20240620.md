## Agenda

### Housekeeping (@bitkeks)

- Any open standards PRs to discuss?
- Ops board
    - [Ops Board for Ops, Status Page and VP12](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/8?layout=table&groupedBy%5BcolumnId%5D=Status&filterQuery=label%3A%22ops%22%2C%22status-page%22%2C%22SCS-VP12%22+-status%3ADone%2CAbandoned+&visibleFields=%5B%22Title%22%2C%22Assignees%22%2C%22Labels%22%2C%22Repository%22%5D)
    - Check: stale issues, unassigned Doings

### Zuul incident from 2024-06-14 (@bitkeks, @o-otte, @gtema, @scoopex)

- Disk full of Zuul VM lead to a corruption of the ZooKeeper data base
- Impact: Secrets of all jobs were deemed to be lost
- We solved it by investigating the container volumes and finding a corrupted file. Deleting it (0 bytes) lead to ZooKeeper loading an older state, working again
- TODO
    - The disk setup must prevent that logs can block the whole system
        - @pixelphantomx started to configure logrotate
    - ZooKeeper must run on another machine than the Zuul executor
        - ZooKeeper has to be clustered, min. 3 Instances for quota
    - Schedule automatic Zuul and ZooKeeper backups and exports from the machine
        - @pixelphantomx started to work on this for the current setup
    - Can we use a dedicated SCS Kubernetes cluster for hosting of Zuul?
        - If yes, @gtema can deliver setup scripts
        - Now that moin cluster is running, we have a dedicated k8s cluster -> do not re-use, but built a parallel cluster that is maintained the same way
        
#### Zuul usage in general

- What critical jobs do we run in Zuul?
    - Standards and Compliance checks
    - Standards Repo ADR syntax check for PRs
    - Security Pipeline
    - E2E Tests CAPI
    - Status Page API Server Code linting for PRs
- What will be added to Zuul in the near future?
    - Building of Container Images
- Kurt: Fetch more and more jobs from Github and execute jobs in Zuul
- Proposal:
    - Use Vault/OpenBao for Secret Handling
        - Zuul only have access to Vault to get secrets if needed for a job
        - Offer easier secret rotation
        - Secrets are only temporary 

### Central API (@joshmue)

- PoC demo is now able to abstract Cluster API and Gardener k8s backends. Customer only says "I need k8s cluster", no knowledge about backend which is used at CSP necessary for customer
- Used part of the SIG Meeting to work in ClusterAPI integration
- Next steps: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/608
    - Improve "Cluster" XRD and composites
    - Distribute XRD and composites in Harbor as configuration package

### IaaS monitoring - report (@matofeder)

- OSISM/K3s - OpenStack API exporter integration
    - All PRs have been merged, see e.g. [#420](https://github.com/osism/ansible-playbooks/pull/420)
    - An issue has been created:  Make use of osism/defaults possible when connection/host is localhost [#1058](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/1058)
- Ongoing
    - Port SCS monitoring features (mainly docs and helm values) to the upstream [#57](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/issues/57)
        - WIP
    - Enable Loki on monitoring.scs.community [#50](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/issues/50). Uses promtail for log export from containers
        - Upgrade loki helm chart deployment - upstream - on review [#100](https://github.com/dNationCloud/kubernetes-monitoring-stack/pull/100) (minior issue with pipeline)
- General discussion regarding container log shipping and central storage
     - Deployment of a log-aggregation endpoint is useful in many use-cases, e.g. Ceph as well
     - Implementation in upstream OSISM to be discussed. There's currently OpenSearch and fluentd used, so Loki would cover the same features
     - Visibility of log shipping should be improved, as soon as its available and stable

### Status Page (@joshuai96)

- Status page observability
    - Status page components provide metrics. See: [#654](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/654)
    - `status-page-api` server provides metrics. See: [#655](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/655)
    - `status-page-deployment` includes a Prometheus and Grafana in the local `KinD` deployment to visualize metrics. See [!11](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/status-page-deployment/pull/11)
    - Next up: [656](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/656). Hopefully with @matofeder
- Status page backend
    - Possible cleanup of `status-page-openapi` due to
        - Missing UUID format. See: [status-page-openapi#17](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/status-page-openapi/issues/17)
        - `go.mod` file location
        - `pkg` directory unsuitable for generation of other code
        - and some more
- Status page web 
    - Work is progressing but nothing new to show
- The Status Page has to be done by beginning of September
    - Current MVP should be done in July
