### Tech preview release: Status Page and API (@joshuai96, @snkaupe)

- Status Page release today!
- Workflow: Deployment, configuration, usage
- Current status available on: https://status.k8s.scs.community
    - [Deployment Documentation](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/status-page-deployment/tree/main/kubernetes/environments/scs-public)
        - Currently deployed on a Kubernetes Cluster with Kustomize
        - Could put everything together in a Helm Chart
            - Would be useful
    - [Docs](https://docs.scs.community/docs/category/status-page/) have been merged
        - Included technical details, quickstart guide, monitoring information, etc.
    - Monitoring is working and can be viewed on https://monitoring.scs.community
    - "Increase text font size" is left over from prototype, to be removed. Accessibility is better with the browser built-in zoom feature
    - For the frontend we are 1-1,5 weeks behind due to sickleave, implementation is going forwards
- Current Status is open for testing, please test and deploy your own

### Report from SIG Central API (@o-otte)

- SIG meeting 2024-07-16
- Should we bundle the definitions for all backends into one xpkg or do we split them? -> Decision: We split the xpkgs
    - (Bundle: everything will be in one package, even if the CSP does not need it)
    - (Split: multiple xpkgs need to be built, but can be separatly installed)

### Zuul Redeployment (@o-otte)

- Anything Gonicus can assist?
    - please get in touch with @pixelphantomx and/or @o-otte
- Security flaw does not seem to be affecting us
- @o-otte gets in touch with @gtema
