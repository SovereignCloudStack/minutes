## Agenda

### Review Sprint Montreal, Travel to Nantes

#### Status-Page App

- Nothing new due to vacation of @joshuai96, still working on the deployment
    - Needs to check with @garloff regarding domain changes
    - @matofeder offers help regarding access to the Kubernetes Cluster

##### Define Milestones for Status-Page App

- As discussed previously aligning the Status-Page App with the half-year releases does not really make sense
- Team: Please come up with milestones for the Status-Page
    - Next Big Milestone would be the deployment
    - @joshuai96 will define more milestones


#### Zuul

- AI from couple weeks ago:
    - _@master-caster: setup interactive session with @osfrickler to solve SSL / LE issues_ - Done?
        - Did not happen yet, @master-caster will get in touch with @osfrickler

- Reports to Matrix chat
    - discussed to use MQTT Broker to report Metrics to Chat
    - @matofeder tested it locally and presented some outputs
    - There are projects to bridge MQTT to Matrix but those are not suitable as Zuul uses a special schema, @matofeder wrote an own bridge, and will push it to the SCS namespace for review, still need to be named
    - Question: Would it be possible to configure filtering on messages to only send failed and/or piplines from some important repos/branches
        - Can be selected in the Pipeline definition by mqtt block
    - Need to discuss which room/bridged for which pipelines we need
    - Should test the bridge and review in the upcoming sprint
        - OSISM role is not capable on setting up the mqtt connection, AI @o-otte create issue to extend the role

- Authenticated Access to Zuul for manual pipeline triggers
    - Feature requested in the Zuul Matrix Channel
    - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/432

#### Central API

- No Updates since last week
    - IAM documentation from OSISM is still needed, i.e. [376](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/376)
        - @artificial-intelligence will ask and report back


#### Observability for KaaS

- @o-otte will come up with a first draft of and ADR next week
- The harbor PS OpenStack project will be reused for Central API and it will be also used for the Observer Cluster. It's dedicated for the MVPs
    - New colleagues form dNation is being onboarded and will help with the Observability topic
