## Agenda

### Housekeeping

#### AI's

- AI _@fkr: Send out invitation to SIG Monitoring next friday_ - ✅
- AI _@o-otte: Move SIG Monitoring to 13:05 and inform teams_ - ✅

#### Central API

- Recap over the last central API meeting
    - Need more documentation from OSISM about federation
- Should design the central API in an agnostic way such that not only Keycloak can implement the IAM capabilities but also e.g. Zitadel or others
    - Reference Implementation should be Keycloak
- Want to use Central API with Cluster Stacks and Crossplane to test it with SCS Developer groups as tenants
    - For building the test infrastructure we should talk to @garloff as he knows the setup with SCS UCS best
- Want to have a long running testbed for integrations. A long running Cluster Stacks Instance is also appreciated 

#### Status Page

- PR for deployment repo with license incoming
- API Write Actions are now secured
- Preparation to deploy API Server to Kubernetes Cluster

#### Zuul 

- Zuul Documentation?
    - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/54
    - Should merge this soon and do additional changes afterwards
- To onboard a new repo a GH issue should be created. For this we want to have GH Issue Template, so needed information can easier be included. Default assignees are @fkr and @master-caster
