### Status Page and API (@snkaupe, @joshuai96)

- How is the Docker compose (or similar) deployment progressing?
    - @joshuai96 prepared a simple deployment on a single VM on GX-SCS
    - Deployment based on k3s to be deployed in single-node setup, because KinD is not production-ready
    - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/status-page-deployment/tree/feat/k3s-deployment/kubernetes/environments/k3s
        - System requirements would be nice to have in the documentation
    - @fkr is testing the deployment
        - Test deployment next week Wednesday after Hackathon onsite
    - API Server could run on its own, but other components like dex and oathkeeper are needed to secure the API
    - Front end not yet containerized
        - First Dockerfile exists, needs more refinement
        - Posting incidents works via REST API, not in frontend
    - @snkaupe shows Swagger API demo, more [requests](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/status-page-api/blob/main/docs/example-requests.md)
    - The Kubernetes-based deployment will be followed up on for now. Testing and feedback will be gathered
- Proposal to do a lightning talk about the Status Page next week
