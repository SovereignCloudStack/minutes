### Status page (@joshuai96)
- Planed downtime (@joshuai96)
    - API spec already allows future incidents [!684](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/684)
    - API server need changes to retrieve planed downtimes [!685](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/685)
- Bruno collection (@joshuai96)
    - [Bruno client](https://www.usebruno.com/) suggested by @fkr
    - Collection created to easily use the status-page-api
    - Interest to share?
    - May add authentication to status-idp.k8s.scs.community
- Concerning access to Github applications, talk to Max, AI @bitkeks
- Frontend (@snkaupe)
    - Been busy with a concurrency bug
    - UI and functional work on login feature will start shortly

### Monitoring (@matofeder)
- Unavailability of SCS monitoring Grafana instance running at monitoring.scs.community
    - It seems that the root cause is the unhealthy state of the k8s cluster database (etcd)
    - Grafana attempts to watch Kubernetes configmaps for its datasource and dashboard definitions, but this watch process fails with errors like:
    ```
    File "/app/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/kubernetes/watch/watch.py", line 182, in stream
    raise client.rest.ApiException(
    kubernetes.client.exceptions.ApiException: (500)
    Reason: InternalError: Internal error occurred: etcdserver: no leader
    ```
    - "S" flavors with SSD local storage for k8s control plane nodes should help and resolve the above -> It would be great to report this in the container call


### Building container images in Zuul

* Is currently WIP, blocked by missing admin rights in Harbor
    * Solved :white_check_mark:
* All jobs that need secrets in Zuul will be needed to use better workflows, Vault
