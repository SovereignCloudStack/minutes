## Agenda

### Zuul Status
- jobs can be imported
- pipeline starts on PR creation
- OSISM pipelines can now be prepared to be imported to the SCS Zuul instance
- issues/#243 to be resolved this week
- Import compliance check from SCS Standards repository
- Everyone who is allowed to create PRs could start a pipeline
    - could lead to security issues (if executed code somehow runs on reused hosts, or is somehow privileged regarding network access or secret access)
        - pipeline executions are isolated in one-time-use VMs
    - could lead to DoS vulnerability
        - infinite loops can be prevented with timeouts
