- what about zuul - there was an _AI_ from the previous weeks (@master-caster to setup call with @osfrickler in finally sorting out the automatic ssl renewal/issueing)

### Status Page

- Milestones:
    - Deployment
        - Deployment and configuration of all systems relevant to running the status page
            - DexIDP
            - Oathkeeper

        - See: [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/jNUH6VT2VzXcJKz3wAhLO2/SCS-Website?type=design&node-id=1023%3A97&mode=design&t=s4aoiodfpWnhD9e2-1) by @maxwolfs
    - Frontend User Authentication
        - Provide the user a possibility to log in with DexIDP (OIDC)
    - CUD Operations
        - Create a concept for creating, updating and deleting resources
        - Implement these concepts in the Frontend for authenticated users

- Topic is status.scs.community should be used -> Should be separate from everything else

### Zuul

- Automatic TLS Certificate Renewal
    - No updated until now, hopes to get in touch with @osfrickler today
    - @berendt reported that the http challege should not get included into the Zuul Role
        - There should be proxy in front of the service as for all the other services
            - Zuul also comes with some sort of proxy, initial thoughts were to not chain proxies
            - @master-caster can continue to work on it

- New Repository for MQTT-Matrix chat bridge project 
    - PR that initializes this project is ready for review [PR#2](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/zuul-mqtt-matrix-bridge/pull/2)
        - Examples of Matrix messages available in the [README](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/zuul-mqtt-matrix-bridge/tree/init?tab=readme-ov-file#matrix-messages)

### Observability for KaaS

- New Repository for Kaas Observability Deployment Manifests
    - [github-manager PR#172](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/github-manager/pull/172)
- KaaS Observer cluster is ready (3xCP + 3xWorker nodes) - it utilizes PS infrastructure, see deployments [notes](https://input.scs.community/kaas-monitoring#Infrastructure)
- The initial MVP-0 demo for KaaS monitoring is scheduled to take place tomorrow during the SIG Monitoring meeting at 1PM

### Central API

- This week was SIG Meeting, discussed topics for the Hackathon
    - Want to bring Cluster Stacks and Central API together

### Standard Operations

- There were issues with live migration on the WaveStack.
    - Impacted several services, e. g. Zuul
    - Don't have any standard Operations
        - Need more insights from the Operators
        - @berendt will bring it up in the product board and then we proceed here
