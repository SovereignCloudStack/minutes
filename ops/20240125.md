## Agenda

### Zuul

#### How to get Zuul Statsd Metrics into the Observer Prometheus Cluster (@matofeder, @o-otte)

- Observability Stack is available and Zuul Metrics can be viewed
- Most metrics of Zuul are statsd formatted metrics

- i.e. [Matrix Discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!pKUMzUsFzuxiNDYhVx:matrix.org/$o8W3l3pafcUcBhinnlTEqSd4LfaZ6jUWPnbR6BG0-NE?via=matrix.org&via=regio.chat&via=matrix.im) on the Zuul Matrix Room. Two Options:
    1. Graphite Server in Observer Cluster
        - Adds some more overhead regarding maintenance
        - Already practiced by OpenDev community, exchange by @matofeder with upstream
        - Is graphite still maintained? It seems that yes:
            - https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web (UI) - last update - 2 months ago
            - https://github.com/graphite-project/whisper (database) - last update - last week
            - https://github.com/graphite-project/carbon (metrics receiver) - last update - 4 months ago
    2. Converting Statsd Metrics to Prometheus Format
        - Need to create own dashboards, since there are no pre-prepared ones for Zuul in Prometheus

- Option 1 is preferred after discussion in the meeting
- demo of Graphite datasource available in the [SCS monitoring - Zuul Host monitoring panel](https://monitoring.scs.community/d/f4f21991b06d8e5f6308eb2b590a4cee/host-monitoring-zuul)

#### Dev instance for Zuul (@o-otte, @PixelPhantomX)
- Dev instance is WIP
- Created VM and testing Ansible Deployment there
    - zuul-dev.scs.community, zuul-logs-dev.scs.community
- Let's Encrypt current topic of implementation, using webserver for LE verification in OSISM

### Central API (@joshmue)

- Building of deployment automation for Central API components
- WIP, no blockers to be expected

### Observability (@matofeder)

* Topic for next week

### Status Page (@snkaupe, coming in later)

* Building the Angular framework for Status Page is completed
* Rendering of incidents is current WIP, using live data
* Fetching live data from status API done in parallel (requesting the actual data to render)
