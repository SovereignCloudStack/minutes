## Agenda

### Sprint Review Izmir

#### Status Page 

Epic: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/285

* Not discussed due to vacation of @joshuai96

#### Zuul

Epic: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/157
* There is a PR ([osism/ansible-collection-services#1126](https://github.com/osism/ansible-collection-services/pull/1126)) against OSISM regarding the LE Topic for Zuul
    * After Let's Encrypt Topic [issues#292](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/292) is done, it can be deployed with only IaC tools
* dNation has setup their own Zuul for their projects, but there was also communication to @master-caster on how to use Zuul. Seems that dNation were blocked by the Wavestack downtime, hence they deployed their own Zuul. Their jobs should be migrated to the SCS Zuul.
* User documentation is needed, see [issues#351](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/351).
    * Got first input from users, so we can start with the documentation in a form of a HowTo. Will be part of Sprint Jena.
    * This should not include how Zuul is installed, but how users can use it to create CI jobs.
    * The preliminaries to set up Zuul are already documented in https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/zuul, missing is how to run the playbook. This should be extended with [issue#399](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/399).
    * Documenation should go in the contribution guide
* [issues#244](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/244) moved out of doing, refinement needed with @fkr, @osfrickler, and @master-caster
* The question regarding Zuul monitoring came up -> [issue#398](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/398). @fkr has a monitoring system that can be used
* Downtime was due to flavor issues, new installation was needed. This implied that users needed new secrets for the Zuul integration
    * This raises the question for backups and HA setup
        * HA: @fungi mentioned ideas in the matrix chat
        * Backups: Needs to be evaluated -> AI: @master-caster, @fkr [issue#400](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/400)
            * The relevant part are the keys that are in the database
            * For compliance checks, the history would be good to have, but those can be written to some other place

#### Observability for KaaS Operator

Epic: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/291
* Getting the infos from the Operators is done
* @fkr and @o-otte will discuss the upcoming ADR, [issue#300](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/300)

#### MVP for Central SCS API

Epic: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/364
* @Joshmue gives a short overview aboput the work of the past two weeks
