## Agenda

### Testing AuthN / AuthZ for Status Page Application

* @joshuai96 needs a way to test various aspects of the status page

* We should be able to get something up and running with cluster api on pco
    * Build local test deployment
    * Get @joshuai96 access to gx-scs

* For R5: API Implementation is done, AuthN/AuthZ is still being done as well as the test deployment, after this the frontend will get designed and developed (R6).

### Report from SIG Central API

* onboarding from new participants
* discussion with Syself how to deploy Kubernetes clusters

### Observability KaaS

* @o-otte and @fkr met on August 30th and went over the results of the survey
* dNation with their [Kubernetes Monitoring Stack](https://github.com/dNationCloud/kubernetes-monitoring-stack) brings a lot to the table - why not base on this / use that? Would avoid a heavy NIHS ;)
    * AI: @o-otte to create an appointment with @matofeder
