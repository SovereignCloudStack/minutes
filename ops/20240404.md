### Status Page (@snkaupe) and Status Page API (@joshuai96)

- Prepare for deployment of components in Kubernetes/containers
    - State of https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/status-page-deployment ?
        - Provides two deployment methods: locally in KinD and in SCS public k8s cluster
        - Is there a way to deploy this more easily, without k8s? Without using container images?
        - The backend container image is built manually from https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/status-page-api --> will be moved into Zuul in the near future
        - There is currently no container for the frontend, WIP
        - Why is k8s-based scaling needed for GET-heavy frontend? Deploy caching and serve static content
        - Dynamic content will later be added, so POST and PUT will be needed as well
        - The main use-case of status page is simple deployment somewhere, without complexity. Maybe k8s-based setup is too complex?
    - Deployment via Ansible in hardware-landscape
        - Can be followed up on after the implementation of container-based setup
- Documentation: status, TODOs
- (@fkr) - prepare for technical preview next week & lightning talk
    - Technical preview moved to next week (after community call), combined with lightning talk
    - Simple deployment: two containers with frontend and backend, based on easily accessible build scripts
    - Docker compose as an alternative
    - PoCs in real-world scenarios
