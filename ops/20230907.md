- There were question about how to use the SCS Container Registry. First Image is now in Harbor.

#### Zuul

#### Observability for KaaS for the Operator

- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/291

    - part of that will be covering the integration of KaaS observability in the existing IaaS ref. implementation stack
 
#### MVP for Central SCS API

### SIG Monitoring yay or nay?

- @o-otte going to ask in the next SIG Monitoring if the timeslot is awesome or just ok for everyone
- maybe move it out of the direct lunchtime
- @jschoone raised the point that the OPS slot is not always used in its full length and that monitoring could be covered here (OPS call) in the time that is not used
