## Agenda

### Housekeeping

### Sprint Review & Planning

#### Status Page

* ADR - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/191
    * re-review needed by @garloff (requested changes implemented?)
    * two minor remarks, ideally addressed before merging, @joshmue to take care

    * Guide for Docs creation: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/blob/main/community/contribute/adding-docs-guide.md

#### Container layer monitoring
* [Hackathon Results](https://input.scs.community/ZwqYC0udTKaP9YYj0FgjJQ#)

* Epic: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/291 (needs refinement)
  * AI @o-otte and @fkr: fill this epic with user stories as a preparation for next SIG Monitoring
  * Goal is to be able to discuss about these user stories in next week's SIG monitoring
  * Did not happend due to time constraints on @fkr's side. Probably it makes sense to postpone this to next week.
  * More progress needed, planned to work on this on SIG Monitoring 2023-03-17
