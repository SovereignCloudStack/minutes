## Agenda

### Housekeeping

- @fkr to be PTO until August 22nd.

### Sprint Review & Planning

#### Status Page

- [pr standards#296](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/296)
- [issues#285](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/285)
- Implementation of the API is finished
- Next steps: Deployment and Frontend
- API has no notion of permissions, if someone has access to the API they can do everything. Authorization and Authentication needs to be done in front of the API
- [issues#367](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/367)
    - Caddy should be used for the policy layer and GitHub should be used as an IdP
        - Caddy Security Plugin could be a fit, still in evaluation
    - separated authN and authZ services
        - could be done with Dex
            - works as OIDC IdP
            - communicates to GH Oauth2
    - third alternative could be oathkeeper
    - too bloated for only a StatusPage?
        - could be valuable learnings for Central API as well
    - [issues#377](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/377) to evaluate alternatives
- For Frontend development
    - Should be implemented from scratch for new API Server
    - Needs to support themes, own colors, logos, etc.
    - @maxwolfs can support regarding the tech stack -> decision next week

#### Zuul

- Nothing new to report
- Next steps for Sprint Hobart:
    - documenation and workshop on how to use Zuul [issues#351](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/351)
    - Fixing Let's Encrypt issue [issues#292](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/292)

#### Central SCS API

- Defined an [MVP epic](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/364)
    - Start work on onboarding users and providing kubeconfigs for them
