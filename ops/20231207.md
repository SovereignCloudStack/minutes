## Agenda

### Status-Page Application deep dive

- local development available: https://github.com/sovereignCloudStack/status-page-deployment
- Docker-based deployment is WIP and going to be finalized next
- frontend currently not part of the deployment repository - but will be added
- example curl/httpie commands for testing api deployment would be helpful
    - especially because of the authorization flow this would be helpful
        - getting JWT token in order to access ressources that are protected
- after the deployment work is done, let's see to get the docs in status-page-api repository into shape for docs.scs.community

### Observability KaaS & IaaS

- [ADR for KaaS Observability Architecture and MVP-0](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/394) - ready for review
- [Blog post](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/pull/797) - ready for review
- Next Steps (MVP-1):
    - Some [tasks](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/291#issuecomment-1780979226) have been proposed
    - Q: What should be prioritized? 
        - Options: 
            - KaaS layer monitoring
            - SCS services monitoring
                - Observer is stabilized for this use case 
                - Observer (grafana) public URL is TLS terminated and available under `scs.community` domain
                - Observer (grafana) authorization is done via OIDC
                - Alerts are sent to the Matrix chat
    - Q: @scoopex: What's our vision, idea or solution for the collection, visualization and alerting of:
        - Ceph storage
        - IaaS layer
        - Node
            - Linux system details (ressources: network behavior, disk usage and behavior, memory behavior, ...)
            - Kernel details/counters
            - Kernel warnings
            - ....
            - Critical services like NTP
        - Hardware
            - health of the hardware (tempartures, disk errors, error counters, memory warnings, ...)
            - power usage
            - link health
            - ...
        - Log aggregation for all aspects above but for internal usage
        - How do we separate customer- and operational monitoring? 
            
### Zuul

- Zuul MQTT to Matrix Bridge
    - Matrix chat report template has been improved - [#7](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/zuul-mqtt-matrix-bridge/pull/7) and [#9](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/zuul-mqtt-matrix-bridge/pull/9)
    - Now v0.3.0-rc1 (PR#9) is deployed and will be validated whether works as expected
        - It works [nice](https://matrix.to/#/!zZBxvKYtOREWRsXARS:matrix.org/$eM72XrYfgB0Xxr4I9hJ3v9KGnOHf1s-TCpmOD8XK9co?via=matrix.org&via=regio.chat) so far
