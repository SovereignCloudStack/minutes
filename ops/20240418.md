### State of the Status Page and API (also Hackathon Review) (@snkaupe)

- What resulted from the k3s-based tests?
    - Only the container for the frontend was needed for the complete deployment
    - Still needs a integration test with the frontend container
- Results from discussions in Arnsberg?
    - Lots of smaller enhancements for the frontend
    - now usable from a container
    - frontend now has a decent state
- @snkaupe prepares a blogpost
- Should publish the tech preview as soon as possible, with sucessful testing, today

### Hackathon review: Central API (@bitkeks)

- We hacked a prototype for Central API, based on current MVP
    - https://input.scs.community/hackathon24-centralapi
    - Goals: Run MVP, understand issues, add Kubernetes/ClusterStacks Crossplane adapter
    - Results: We successfully produced a working prototype that was able to talk to
        - OpenStack, creating VMs and networks,
        - vanilla Kubernetes, to create namespaces and pods and 
        - Cluster Stacks management cluster to request workload clusters
        - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/central-api/pull/6
- Next steps: 
    - sync with @joshmue on how to proceed
    - Cleanup of the prototype
    - Setting up customer namespace, RBAC and credentials
    - Test OIDC where applicable
    - User management in OpenStack? (following up Ralf's suggestion)
    - Define resources in .api.scs.community and adapt Crossplane compositions
- Org: @bitkeks will not attend Central API SIG next week
