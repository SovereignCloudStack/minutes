### Zuul Bot Reporting (@scoopex)

- What is our plan to deal with Zuul reporting in the Zuul Chatroom? 
- Situation
    - I am currently receiving a lot of alerts that I have simply deactivated. 
    - Alerts sees to be reported in a continous and repeating manner
- How can we improve the situation?
    - Who feels responsible or takes care of it and how do we keep the bot chat organized?
        - Channel is currently reviewed by at least one person (@o-otte)
        - Alerts are valid, ansible-galaxy errors have retries 
    - Is there a possibility to mute/claim problems
        - Use Matrix emoji reactions for coordination (chat-ops)
- "zuul-bot" continously seems to report problems with the "openstack-scs-flavor-check" and "scs-check-gx-scs-main"
    - --> check if failure is caused by Zuul or by Compliance-error
    - If compliance fails on CSP side, it must be forwarded/escalated
    - Every run/repo should have at least one responsible person that picks up problems
    - If no one picks up, write/check in channel
        - @scoopex will take that role for the next weeks
        - after some time (2-3 weeks) we will improve, document the workflow and rotate the responsible person
    - @bitkeks updates room description with info about workflow, mail
    - If tickets get more complex, Zuul should post the relevant workflow together with the issue
