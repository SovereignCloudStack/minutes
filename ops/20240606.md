## Agenda

### Housekeeping

- Any open PRs?
- Currently there are issues merging PRs as automated GitHub checks are not running, i.e. [Example PR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/status-page-web/pull/17). @bitkeks will look into this.

### IaaS monitoring - report (@matofeder)

- The SCS monitoring platform already includes OpenStack API exporter and dashboard integration - read the [docs](https://docs.scs.community/docs/operating-scs/components/monitoring/docs/iaas)
    - Port to the OSISM codebase is on review:
        - https://github.com/osism/ansible-collection-services/pull/1434
        - https://github.com/osism/defaults/pull/181
        - https://github.com/osism/ansible-playbooks/pull/420
            - There is still one unresolved [issue](https://github.com/osism/ansible-playbooks/pull/420#issuecomment-2137301141)
                - When play defines  `hosts: localhost` the default variables defined within https://github.com/osism/defaults/pull/181/files are not applied!
- Ongoing: The SCS monitoring platform - CEPH monitoring integration
    - CEPH already contains build-in prometheus exporters (2 exporters from the latest stable Reef release a.k.a v18)
    - Rook simplifies integration into SCS monitoring stack a lot
    - Grafana dashboards: 
        - [ceph-mixin](https://github.com/ceph/ceph-mixins) dashboards used also in OSISM look unmaintained (last updated 2 years ago)
            - With the v18 release metrics changed so this dashboards do not work out of the box
        - dashboards referenced in [the Rook docs](https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/Documentation/Storage-Configuration/Monitoring/ceph-monitoring.md?plain=1#L221) look maintained
            - Will be checked with the most recent stable Ceph version
- All updates will be pushed upstream into dNation monitoring solution

### Report SIG Central API (@o-otte)

- Did not have much to discuss and used the slot for work on the central API
    - managed to build Crossplane Composites, Compositions and Claim to create a Gardener Cluster, see [PR central-api#13](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/central-api/pull/13)
    - Claim only supports Kubernetes Version as parameter right now
    - Created diagram that matches Crossplane wording to our Central API approach
    - Next Steps: Same for ClusterAPI and extending Claim to support more parameters

### Cloudmon (@piobig2871)

- Updated PR on CloudMon/Stackmon https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/576
    - Please review
