## Agenda

### Revisit OpenInfra Compliance Checks
- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/300
- Decision last time: use SCS-internal refstack server to store check results, Zuul job to run tests
- question: how would the Zuul job work with the various vendor clouds? (see [this table](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/tree/main#scs-compatible-clouds))
    - Will we continue to use Github actions for the remaining certification tests (flavor naming, entropy, image metadata etc.)?
        - No
    - How do we store the tenant credentials (necessary for Tempest) for all these clouds? (Zuul in addition to Github?)
        - Zuul uses a key pair, and we encrypt our secrets with this key pair and put them into the repo

### Zuul for SCS in general

- how to create the compliance check table?
    - Zuul check stores complete results in static file
        - other checks will read this file and create Badgets
    - Create Badges as PNG files in web storage
        - leads to problems with GitHub caches
- how do we move forward in order to enable the SCS teams to add jobs to Zuul
    - Documentation for SCS Developers [#351](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/351)
- what is needed to solve this: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/292 ?
    - probably better to use dns01 challenge
- Certificate expired for https://zuul.scs.community
    - will be renewed manually

### Status Page
- API implemented
    - cleanup pending
    - bit trouble with OpenAPI specs

### Preliminary Container Layer Survey Results
- Compacted Results are available at [#299](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/299)
    - ADR needs to be written based on that
