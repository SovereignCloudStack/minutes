### GX-SCS Problems (@gtema)

- Zuul has problems getting VMs
- Harbor is not accessible
- Status Page also not available
- AI: @fkr establish contact to PS
    - Person of PS gets in touch with @gtema
- GX-SCS is only sponsored and meant as a playground
    - Harbor should be on a reliable infrastructure
    - Mirroring of Harbor to Quay?
    - OSISM uses Quay as mirror

### SBOM Generation (@gtema)

- Should be done in CI
- Should be done for all deliverables
- Sample for OSISM: https://github.com/osism/container-image-osism-ansible/blob/main/playbooks/build.yml#L105-L111
- SCS Release should contain a list of all artifacts
    - Can be a list of Images with digests
    - From the digests, the SBOMs can be generated
- Sample images file for OSISM: https://github.com/osism/sbom/blob/main/8.0.0/openstack.yml
- Comparing Syft and trivy for SBOM Generation
    - Syft seem to generate more content for container images
    - Trivy can only generate CyclonDX and SPDX 
    - While syft has an own syft format to work with grype a lot better https://github.com/anchore/syft?tab=readme-ov-file#output-formats
    - Example was generated using the same output format
- Where to put list of images?
    - May need an ADR
    - Currently worked on: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/pull/28
