### Next steps zuul

Use the slot to deep dive into this and actually do stuff.

- proper rights management zuul
- public scs zuul app || non scs-org repos access to scszuulapp
    - no need to have it public
    - currently it is sufficient to have it enabled for scs org on github
    - it is OK to have testrepos within the scs org
        - if this bothers us, we can always have seperate orgs for test & sandbox and install the scszuulapp there as well
- showcase of zuul UI

### License for Status Page Application

Distinction between OpenAPI Spec and implementation?

Let's use a license that fits into the (Go) ecosystem.

AGPL would fit to StatusPage implementation that may be used as SaaS - effectively enforcing contributions back to upstream.

Conclusion:

* MIT for OpenAPI Spec
* AGPLv3 for StatusPage implementation **?**
    * Create PR
