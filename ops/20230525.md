## Agenda

### Status Page - looking at the current items together
* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/281
* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/status-page-openapi/pull/4
  * OpenAPI structure work:
      * Subresources are sometimes suboptimal
      * Relations too limited: One incident can affect several resources and can have several impacts, but this is not currently reflected in structure yet
      * Phases of an incident also need work
      * Updates of an incident should be subresources (they are always dependent in the incident)
  * Drawing/Graph would be very helpful!
  * OpenAPI spec allows for automated API-server code generation

### Revamping monitoring
* Restart efforts (@artificial-intelligence, @Nils98Ar)
* Get inspiration from https://monitoring.mixins.dev
* In general continue to use exporters for prometheus
    * What metrics do we want to collect?
    * Existing mindmap: (inspired by Awesome-Prometheus and StackHPC): (TBD somewhere in OSISM)
* Architecture: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Drafts/overview_monitoring_architecture.svg
* SIG Monitoring will happen and thrive

### Zuul for SCS #157
* Compliance checks are integrated (#279)
    * Can be triggered by PRs in github
    * Secrets for (application credential) connections to clouds stored in github secrets
        * Security guide needed: How app creds are handled secured and limited in power (by quotas, read-only constraints, etc. - https://governance.openstack.org/tc/goals/selected/consistent-and-secure-rbac.html)
    * Try to save on setup time by reusing environments *for stateless/idempotent tests*
* Present to larger audience soon #290
