### SCS Zuul (@o-otte)

- Current status of persistence of DB and ZooKeeper
    - Zookeeper and MariaDB data now use dedicated docker volumes which can easily be saved
- Zuul Bot enhancement? (@scoopex)
    - The Zuul Bot does not seem to notify you when Zuul Runs change back to a normal status.
    - It would be cool if the Zuul Bot would let you know when Zuul Runs are permanently not working.
    - Would such an extension make sense?
        - Bot would need to track state of pipelines/jobs
    - Can we use it to improve the review process?
        - Currently only fails are reported to minimize noise in the channel
        - Pushing mqtt to Prometheus and towards AlertManager was investigated, but there's currently no direct connection from Zuul to Prometheus. Related: https://github.com/hikhvar/mqtt2prometheus
            - Pick up previous work: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/zuul/issues/5
- Moving toward gathering statistics from Zuul seems like the more promising path for now -> @scoopex
- Zuul review process (@scoopex): We introduced the Zuul process and after a few weeks we wanted to check whether we wanted to continue with it. Do we need the zuul messages [review process](https://input.scs.community/s/i7sc2a01h#)?
  - Yes!
