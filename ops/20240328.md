### News from VP12 regarding OSHM and StackMon (@piobig2871)

- VP12 is the new team to work on a replacement for the OpenStack Health Monitor (the long bash script)
    - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/openstack-health-monitor/
    - OSHM is NOT running in Zuul, but at every CSPs site
    - Instances can be reached via the "HM" links on https://docs.scs.community/standards/certification/overview
    - Some CSPs run into storage issues when executing the OSHM inside a VM, integration into Zuul would be nice (but will not be done with OSHM due to new stack..!)
- New code base: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/scs-health-monitor
    - Current WIP: pushing metrics and stats into Prometheus stack and exporter
    - Behave: https://github.com/behave/behave
    - BehaveX: https://github.com/hrcorval/behavex
    - Clean up of testing resources is handled in separate script as well, resetting the test environment
- Evaluation of StackMon and meeting with Artem (original developer) brought more insights into how StackMon could be used in SCS
    - Project website: https://stackmon.org
    - Result of the evaluation showed, that we will not deploy StackMon
    - Repository can be found [here](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/scs-health-monitor)


### Report from Central API SIG meeting 2024-03-26 (@bitkeks)

- https://input.scs.community/2024-scs-sig-central-api?view
- Central API session planned for Hackathon at Gonicus (April 2024)
- Another CSP brought insights into the round
    - Scaling of Central API across multiple company services is an open discussion point in our ecosystem (small CSPs vs. large CSPs with multiple teams)
    - Billing, billing, billing
    - Perspective on Go libraries, SDKs
    - What about connecting non-SCS-backends to Central API?
    - GAIA-X Service Catalogue


### Zuul (@matofeder)

- Zuul-MQTT-Matrix bridge [v0.5.1 has been released](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/zuul-mqtt-matrix-bridge/releases/tag/0.5.1)
    - Fixes: [Huge headline messages periodic-daily/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider](https://input.scs.community/qXSVybD1Tpmdo4WTKTRTlw?view#Current-activities)
    - Fixes: Job history link
    - Adds: Headline message colors and new icon for the failed job
- Zuul VM volume utilization is [high](https://monitoring.scs.community/d/f4f21991b06d8e5f6308eb2b590a4cee/host-monitoring-zuul?refresh=10s&var-datasource=PC96415006F908B67&from=now-15m&to=now&var-job=zuul-scs&orgId=1) and caused Zuul outages
    - Zuul containers log to /var/log/zuul; /var/log/nodepool dirs
    - Log dirs are not managed by the logrotate, istead there are managed by the python logging lib. 
        -> possible solution: adjust related python logging configs to remove old logs
        - AI: Matej pings Oliver
    - Build logs need to be persisted elsewhere to guarantee link availability
        - Either persist forever or document the log rotation length ("every four weeks")
        - Increase disk size from 100G to 2T? -> Should be done to have more flexibility -> AI: Matej will ask PS to raise quota
        - Do we need export to S3 storage? -> overengineered, not now
        - Compress log files? -> See if already done
