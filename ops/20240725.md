### Zuul (@gtema)

- new instance in K8s is nearly complete
    - New Zuul deployed on Kubernetes, deployed by ClusterStacks on WaveStack
    - Uses Worker Nodes on GX-SCS
        - Issues with different MTUs, leads to difficulties with ssh
        - MTU negotiation is disabled on the Kubernetes Cluster
        - MTU on GX-SCS is already at max (WaveStack is higher)
    - Integrated with openBao (on the zuul infra level). Enabling jobs to use openBao is a next step
        - Secrets are provisioned in openBao
        - Secret can be easily rotated
        - Transparent auditing on secret usage
    - Keycloak integration present
        - People can login with GitHub
        - Group of people have admin capabilities
    - Publishing logs to ObjectStorage will be done today
    - New Deployment available at https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/system-config/tree/main/kubernetes/zuul
        - Two Kubernetes Clusters
            - Management:
                - Runs Keycloak
                - In the future also ArgoCD
            - Zuul
        - Next step also add authentication similar to the Moin Cluster
        - MQTT Bridge to be included with the help of @matofeder
            - Maybe only report failing runs for periodic pipelines
