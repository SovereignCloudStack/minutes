## Agenda

### Status Page App

What needs to be done for people to use it and to get feedback from potential users:
- Technical Preview API Server?
    - Current deployment is done with kustomize
    - May want to use Helm in the future due to better templating 
- Technical Preview Frontend?
    - Will be in development as soon as the deployment of the API server completely defined 

### Zuul for SCS

- Post Mortem Zuul issues from last week
    - What happend:
        - Nodepools could not be create due to unkown fact
        - As @master-caster is on vacation, @o-otte stepped in
        - @o-otte had no permissions to access the Zuul Head Node, only workers
        - @o-otte tried to add new SSH keys for access by modifing the used Volume and encountered several issues on the WaveStack
            - After VM was stopped, no Snapshots could be created (Operation looped in creating state, or errored, Snapshot had 0 Bytes) or deleted
            - VM could not be restarted, No Error message, looped in Powerup Task
        - @o-otte involved WaveStack Support
        - Support resolve the issues with undeletable Snapshots
        - Found out issue with VM not restarting was with using deprecated Flavor Name, Resize with new Flavor Name worked
            - Now also Snapsshots could be created and managed
        - SSH Access could be aquired by @o-otte
        - Nodepool VMs were also tried to be create with deprecated Flavor Names, this was fixed
        - @o-otte and @matofeder debugged with a minimal PR if steps above resolved the problem, this was verified
        - @matofeder continued to adapt the e2e to the setup of the SCS Zuul Nodepool which later was also successful
        - Changes that were done need to be put into Ansible Playbook/Roles to persist
    - AI @o-otte to create new GH issues to enhance reliability 
    - Use of a playbook to roll out SSH keys of relevant people to VMs automatically, so all relevant people has access

### SIG Central API
