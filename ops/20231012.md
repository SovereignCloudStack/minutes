### Housekeeping

- SIG Monitoring tomorrow? -> @fkr will remove it from the calendar 

### Zuul
- Proposal for Matrix notification by @matofeder
    - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/zuul/issues/5
    - originated in KaaS, but seems to affect the whole Zuul topic
    - Decision: start with option `a` and replace this with `b` when the prometheus stack is available
- @scoopex (SRE @ SCS) to be looped in
