### Status page (@joshuai96)
- Status Page and API, release July 18th: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/673
- Documentation (@joshuai96)
    - All major components have some documentation and a PR is open to add them to the `docs` repo. [docs!207](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/207)
- Deployment (@joshuai96)
    - Sharing secrets for development environment to a second OAuth app?
    - Current workflow: secrets for the app are shared by devs to use in their applications
    - AI @joshuai96: talk to Marc to create a new app for testing access
    - OIDC with PKCE provides the possibility to configure the application without using client secrets
      - we should check if that is supported by Github, tt doesn't look like that at the moment, but some research is still needed
      - result: its not supported: https://github.com/github/docs/pull/24965
- Monitoring (@joshuai96)
    - Include metrics to SCS Grafana with @matofeder? [status-page-deployment/!11](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/status-page-deployment/pull/11) [#653](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/653)
    - Both sync on this issue
- API (@joshuai96)
    - Planing for a further MVP (after July release) which will include planned maintenance events
