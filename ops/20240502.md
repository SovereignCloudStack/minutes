- OSISM K3s monitoring deployment 
    - It is possible (since the last SCS release) to deploy SCS observability solution into management k3s cluster (OSISM deployment) 
        - `$ osism apply kubernetes-monitoring`
        - there were some issues:
            - FIX: OSISM k3s custer setup - Fix k3s defaults: [#177](https://github.com/osism/defaults/pull/177)
            - FIX: OSISM k3s monitoring deployment - Fix monitoring of K3s control plane components: kube-scheduler, kube-proxy, and kube-controller-manager - [#401](https://github.com/osism/ansible-playbooks/pull/401)
- Landscape monitoring
    - Our discussion https://input.scs.community/IHjU5U2cTzaNHEx5k5nz5Q# (motivation and result of the meeting), see at bottom of pad
