### Agenda

#### Stabilizing SCS-compatible IaaS v5

sponsor: @mbuechse

- proposal in this PR: [standards#824](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/824)
  - regarding content
    - known from draft version (see [compliance monitor](https://compliance.sovereignit.cloud/page/table))
    - as expected, but two standards in separate target
    - all but two partners already compliant, and those two should be super easy to become compliant
  - regarding draft v6
    - include scs-0123-v1!!! (e.g., Octavia)
  - regarding timeline
    - stabilization date today (2024-11-14)
    - v5 would turn effective on 2024-11-16 (halfway into the month)
      - note: v4 would stay effective (see below)
    - v4 would turn into "warn" status on 2025-01-01
- decision: merge this PR with Kurt's formal approval (pester him about that)
