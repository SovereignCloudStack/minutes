### Designing a tamper-proof badge

- goals
    - customers of compliant CSPs should be able to easily verify that the offering is conformant
        - the PNG or JPG itself is not enough, it needs to be bundled with some signature (watermark) or website (which is itself signed/authenticated via SSL)
    - design a solution and build a PoC within July/August
    - earnestly consider Gaia-X Federation Services (gxfs)
- Gaia-X crash course
    - verifiable credentials: W3C standard
    - gxfs NOT (Notarization service) can issue verified credentials
    - gxfs OCM (Organisation Credential Manager) can store the credentials (think wallet)
- side remark: these gxfs components have been implemented in SCS by Syself
- Questions
    - operational requirements for gxfs: who can host the services etc.
    - what is the UX for the CSP: do they need to host a service, will they accept that?
        - if they participate in Gaia-X, they will have the OCM anyway
        - otherwise, there will be other solutions (send certificate via e-mail)
    - what is the UX for the CSP's customer to verify the credential?
        - e.g., check chain of trust for the SCS public key
- next steps; who does what by when
    - @alexander-diab to present pitch at next installment of the SIG
    - @mbuechse (et al.) to look into the OCM
