### Successor to OpenStack Powered Compute

sponsor: @depressiveRobot

- Issue: [standards#1010](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/1010)
- PR: [standards#1047](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/1047)
- draft standard with supplement documenting how to use Tempest
- step-by-step instructions should be documented and validated by operators (@chrisschwa, @berendt, @fzakfeld)

### SCS-0007 naming

sponsor: @depressiveRobot

- the current PR [standards#1026](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/1026) for SCS-0007 was presented in the Forum's call on 2025-12-12
- the idea with the points was well received
- However the naming of the certification levels is still a topic
  - it needs to be looked at again
- term "level" already used in [SCS-0003-v1](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0003-v1-sovereign-cloud-standards-yaml)
  - should we use another term to avoid confusion?
  - alternatives: grade, degree, rank
- Q: what circle of people would be best suited to discuss this? and when?
- _AI @depressiveRobot: forum should invite relevant (marketing-savvy) people to a break-out session_

### Onboarding SCS Hardware Landscape

sponsor: @depressiveRobot

### Recent cosmetic changes in IaaS scope and compliance monitor

sponsor: @mbuechse

- **DONE** [standards#1053](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/1053): Migrate SCS-compatible IaaS v3 through v5.1 to fine-grained testcases
- **also DONE** [standards#1055](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/1055): restructure CM details page
- --> quick demo by @mbuechse

### S3 feature standardization

sponsor: @toothstone, @depressiveRobot, @mbuechse

- issues: [standards#1003](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/1003) and [standards#1004](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/1004)
- open questions to be resolved
  - 1003: what is meant by S3? (API capabilities)
  - 1004: how to discover S3 from OpenStack? (endpoint)
- current status (1004) causes ambiguous test case, see PR [standards#1063](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/1063#discussion_r2727253964)
- also, if CSPs enable Swift just to satisfy our tests -- instead of participating in the making of the standards -- I feel we have failed (@mbuechse)
- having a dedicated entry for S3 would be the cleanest solution, however: check what other CSPs outside SCS ecosystem are doing before we design a new service type

### Improve UX for admin tooling

sponsor: @mbuechse

- this is about [openstack-image-manager](https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager) and [openstack-flavor-manager](https://github.com/osism/openstack-flavor-manager/)
- I would argue they are virtually obligate for SCS, because the respective standards are so strict as to require tool support
- as an operator who is now virtually forced to use these tools, I still want to be able to do with them whatever I could do without them (e.g., using the openstack CLI)
  - side note: one can always use the openstack CLI in addition, but that is tedious and quite unsatisfying
- however, the tools are quite restrictive:
  - the flavor manager accepts a custom URL via `--url`, but one has to set `--name` as well to make that effective
  - the image manager will not accept certain valid values for `os_distro` (such as `rocky`)
  - the image manager will not accept certain valid fields, such as `hw_firmware_type`
- I would be willing to contribute to upstream, but I can also imagine for SCS to have its own SCS-branded tools
  - having the tools inside the same github org as the standards repo would mean we could adapt the tools quickly to changes (because the same people can do it without being members of both orgs)
- _AI @mbuechse: ask operators in Lean Operator Coffee what they use and what experience they have_
