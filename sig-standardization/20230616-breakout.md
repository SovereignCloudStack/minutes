## 2023-06-16 Break-out Session

### Participants (github handles preferred)
- @maxwolfs
- @mbuechse
- @alexander-diab

### Agreement:
- Alex to write two liner for certification process
- Alex to write description of terms for glossary
- Max to mockup top level table, certification set version progress chart


### Agenda


#### Mechanism for compliance validity and certification process
- define and describe process in text form with correct taxonomy!!!
- Visual description:
    - Top Level table: List CSPs with a label IaaS compliant yes (green)
    - second level table: which version, which layer 
       - maybe (up for debate): only show latest compliant standard version for each layer (iaas, caas)

#### Taxonomy
- What is a layer, level, track, compliance, certification, standard, version, release, dependency/pre-requisite
    - differentiate betweeen inner (scs community org) and outer (csp, etc) perspective
- AD: populate glossary and reference: https://docs.scs.community/docs/glossary/
- make definition of dependency more precise: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0003-v1-sovereign-cloud-standards-yaml.md#dependency
    - is it actually more a pre-requisite?

- Define the following:
    - layer
    - level
    - compliance
    - certified (certification package / set)
    - standard
    - version
    - release
    - pre requisite instead of dependent

- For internal use we may also define:
    - track

#### further information
- how are single standards progressed through levels?
