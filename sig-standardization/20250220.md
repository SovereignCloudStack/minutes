### Agenda

#### Domain manager policy

sponsor: @fkr

- @gtema has opened PR [standards#879](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/879), discussion already ongoing :rocket: 
- Unified limits (quotas per domain) remove the need for limiting the number of projects per domain
    - Supported by all core projects (marked as "experimental" b/c some projects don't support it yet)
- Suggestion for MANDATORY from @gtema:
    - Role assignment
    - Project creation
    - Project editing
- Suggestion for RECOMMENDED from @gtema:
  - Domains per customer
    - (This allows CSPs to move towards compliance that are using a single domain for all customers)
  - User management (because federation makes users not being managed locally)
  - Group management (ditto) -- should sync upon login
  - Project deletion -- different possibilities for cleanup (recommend to reject deletion if ressources are still there to make users responsible to cleaning up)
- Suggestion for RECOMMENDED FOR NOW:
  - Some recommended features may never become mandatory whereas others should become mandatory in the future.
  - Project creation and Project editing would fall in this category
    - So let's demote it to RECOMMENDED for now and advocate to get it adopted
    - Same for role assignment (as it only makes sense with a fully adopted domain-manager)

=> Conclusion: Domain-manager role as a whole is (strongly) recommended for now and will trickle down to providers through newer OpenStack versions, so we reconsider this as mandatory in a year.

- Side-activity: Make recommended standards compliance more visible to support advocating for adoption of them.
  - _AI @mbuechse: put non-mandatory certification targets on agenda_
- How to cleanly communicate this
  - Downgrade all requirements to recommended for now
  - Can still have language that differentiates between recommended things that we expect to become mandatory with the increasing adoption of domain-manager
  - Then merge PR
- Side discussion: Project editing can change names which provider may (but probably shouldn't) rely upon
