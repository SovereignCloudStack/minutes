### Agenda

- How do we document and file a certification process? What will be our registry? 
	* Option A : CSP uploads successful check log to a dedicated github repository
	* Option B : CSP emails the check log file to the according SCS certification officer, who stores this on the SCS file system and maintains a spreadhseet
- Regulations for Certification Stamp/Logo 

- AD : Pull request [#239](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/239) started in order to describe the non-technical certification process. Question raised: In a compliance check and certification issuing process. Do we have to capture and file, which infrastructure (e.g. by host names) is specifically certified, i.e. where the script has been checked on standards?
