### Housekeeping

#### Designate people to transfer minutes and report in community call

- @mbuechse

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @mbuechse and @fdobrovolny: move [issues/#332](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/332) forward_
    - open
- _AI: put license topic on agenda for May 30_
    - open (keep until then)
- _AI @martinmo: add requirement that the image should be recent (see k8s version policy standard)_
    - @mbuechse needs to be more clear and specific when putting down AIs!
- _AI @mxmxchere: write (short) DR on this and then change image def yaml (new version => draft, and then stabilize)_
    - <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/582>
- _AI @josephineSei: write mail to list with specific date where there's no conflict with lean operator coffee or similar_
    - mail seems to have been blocked and stuck in moderation
    - will try again (renew AI)

### Agenda 

#### Flavor extra-specs only allowed for select flavors?

sponsor: @berendt

- see [standards/#574](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/574) for the question
- see also [this response](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/574#issuecomment-2114282056) from @mbuechse
- @berendt convinced @mbuechse in a one-on-one meeting that the current state of affairs doesn't work for customers
- @mbuechse proposed to relax the test script so "spurious" properties will be tolerated
- need new version of scs-0103 that officially allows these properties
- _AI @mbuechse: write issue to relax test script and introduce new version of scs-0103_

#### Tracking moving targets (TLS recommendations from Mozilla)

sponsor: @markus-hentsch

- originated from discussion in IaaS call on 2024-05-08, concerns [PR standards#548](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/548)
    - maintaining an exhaustive and correct rule set for TLS security settings is a huge responsibility and maintenance effort
    - current idea is to move from mandating and maintaining detailed rules (e.g. "you MUST NOT use any RC4 cipher") to referring to externally maintained presets such as Mozilla's TLS presets
- Mozilla's TLS recommendations: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Recommended_configurations
    - how would versioning the standard vs. versioning the reference work?
        - (Mozilla's recommendations may also be a moving target, also sslyze library version)
        - would conformance script always check using latest sslyze preset?
- "Trouble is if the external ref is a moving target -- can we reference a specific version and then update as we review upstream changes?"
    - we can pin the version: <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#JSON_version_of_the_recommendations>
    - it should be recent, otherwise the standard will not be taken seriously
    - it should not change more often than the CSPs can manage
    - maybe lift Mozilla JSON version with each new certificate scope version; within scope version, only lift minor-level or even patch-level versions
    - _AI @mbuechse: draft a mechanism for the certificate-scope yaml to declare parameters for standards_

#### Update on making CAPI image mandatory and recent

sponsor: @mxmxchere

- final minute of the meeting
- _AI @mxmxchere to collect opinions from @frosty-geek and possibly others_
