### Agenda

#### Meeting schedule for SIG Standardization/Certification after August 2024

sponsor: @mbuechse

- there will be no SIG meeting on Sept 5 because of the EOF event
- after that, meetings continue as usual, next one being on Sept 19
- however, the following dates are at risk:
    - Oct 3: public holiday in Germany
    - Oct 17: @mbuechse is not available
    - Oct 31: public holiday in Saxony
    - Nov 1: public holiday in states with pope
    - Nov 28: @mbuechse is not available
- in addition, @mbuechse won't be available on:
    - Sept 12
    - Oct 24
    - Nov 7
    - Nov 18 till end of Nov
- that leaves us (or rather @mbuechse) with:
    - Sept 19
    - Nov 14 (attn: OSBA connect)
- options:
    - usual slot/unusual week: Sep 26, Oct 10
    - unusual slot
    - try double-slot?
- discussion
    - @fkr is bound to usual slot, plus maybe one workshop
    - _AI @mbuechse: switch to weekly with (many) exceptions_
    - workshop Nov 8?
    - _AI @mbuechse: doodle the workshop date, e.g., two blocks of 90 minutes_

#### Mandatory services: s3 or swift/object-storage or both?

sponsor: @gtema

- see [this discussion](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/587#discussion_r1735739766)
- keep in mind that we standardize APIs, not services (maybe change heading)
- make S3 mandatory in any case
- drop the word object-store (which OpenStack people may misinterpret as implying swift) in this case to reduce probablity of confusion
- discuss whether to make swift mandatory as well or merely recommended/welcome -- definitely have a separate row for that API
- S3 should also be mandatory feature for KaaS (!)
- _AI @mbuechse: write issue to get S3 requirement into KaaS certificate scope_

#### Software licenses

sponsor: @mbuechse

- continuing discussion of this week's product board
- document [license considerations](https://docs.scs.community/community/license-considerations) not linked in sidebar
    - will be fixed (@bitkeks)
- @gtema has run DependencyTrack on some SCS repositories
    - Lightning talk wanted!
