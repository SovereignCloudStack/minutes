### Agenda
* Converting Design-Docs into ADRs & Standards
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/207
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/208
* Dealing with image metadata compliance fail
    - >1yr old standard not implemented by Operators (despite not being controversial)
    - Compliance test only since mid Sep 2022 (Docs/Design-Docs/tools/)
    - Deadline 2022-10-31 passed
    - Providers wanting openstack image-manager to handle it (which is WIP)
        * see https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/197
    => strong vote against implementing things outside of image-manager
    => Learning: Conformance tests needed, tooling needed
* Documenting Standards

=> Table can be generated based on the individual documents AND a metadata file (yaml) that indexes the relevant docs
* We can use staging for testing the layout: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website#testing-changes-on-staging-branch
