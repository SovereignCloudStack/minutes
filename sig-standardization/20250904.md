#### Check pending Action Items

- _AI @garloff: create PR for openstack-image-manager to add field `os_purpose`_
  - DONE: [OSISM/openstack-image-manager#952](https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/pull/952)
- _AI @mbuechse: create a check list (regarding scs-0125) and then ask the vendors (OSISM, ALASCA) whether this is currently feasible_
  - open

### Agenda

#### SCS certificates

sponsor: @fkr/@depressiveRobot

- showcasing certificates for SCS-compatible IaaS and SCS IaaS Integrator
- proposed changes
  - "the above-mentioned product"
  - remove specification -> "meets the requirements of ~~the specifications~~"


#### SCS certification application forms

sponsor: @fkr

- There is a draft for the application form for SCS-0004 and SCS-0007 applications
- I'd like to go over them with the group before they're discussed on the forums call on Friday


#### keep supplements as drafts

sponsor: @garloff

- see discussion https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/980
  - either stay in phase Draft indefinitely
    - field `status` becomes expendable (only raises questions)
  - or switch to Stable at some point, but w/o any real consequence in terms of editing
    - introduce confusion about the meaning of Stable (across document types)
- proposal: remove field `status` from Supplement docs
  - PR [standards#981](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/981)


#### Revisit `os_purpose` topic

sponsor: @garloff

- new field in scs-0102-image-metadata
  - see PR [standards#970](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/970)
- corresponding implementation in openstack-image-manager
  - see PR [OSISM/openstack-image-manager#952](https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/pull/952)
- @garloff iterated through the image definitions and found a few that may warrant changes in PR#970
- proposal to reintroduce `network` for OPNsense image (and VyOS and Amphorae -- but those are not in image-mgr currently)
  - no objection
- proposal to rename `capinode` to `k8snode` for gardenlinux, talos, flatcar (in addition to ubuntu-capi-image)
  - no objection
  - add requirement to standard: image w/os_purpose `k8snode` must have preinstalled OCI-compatible runtime and kubelet
- _AI @garloff to update both PRs_


#### Q: images with container runtime?

sponsor: @mbuechse

- does SCS recommend any VM image that comes with a container runtime?
- or does SCS have any suggestions on how to best set up a VM with a container runtime (e.g., using cloud_init)
- see previous agenda item: `k8snode` looks appropriate
- Q: add flatcar to recommended images?
  - _AI @mbuechse: survey CSPs_
