#### Check AIs from last time

- migrate compliance monitor from scs1 to scs2
  - DONE, thanks to @garloff
  - fyi, scs1 is going to be shut down entirely next week
- continue discussion on the topic of domain manager
  - will be added to next week's agenda as planned
  - @gtema has opened PR [standards#879](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/879), discussion already ongoing :rocket: 

### Agenda

#### Current state regarding manual checks/audits

sponsor: @mbuechse

- refined language on this topic to be found in PR [standards#781](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/781), which has been pending since September 2024
- dropped supplement for the time being because maintaining the redundancies is too much effort at the moment; the file is kept as part of branch [feat/scs-0004-w1](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/tree/feat/scs-0004-w1)
- success: merged as draft!
- _AI @fkr: make sure to take this to forum scs-standards in a tl;dr fashion_

#### Open pull requests

sponsor: @mbuechse

- PR [standards#576](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/576)
  - create file `Standards/scs-0106-v1-evaluate-current-state-of-cloudmon.md` (a decision record)
  - about the new health monitor (VP12)
  - review was strongly negative: the reasoning was perceived as being biased
  - however, it would be good to document the decision for posterity
  - still-open question: will the new health monitor be adopted?
  - since this topic is not related to standardization per se, we could move this document into the repository that harbors the new health monitor; treat it as historical record, not as authoritative or official SCS position
  - _AI @mbuechse: move to code repo scs-health-monitor_
  - _AI @garloff: add note "maintenance mode" to the "old" openstack-health-monitor_
- PR [standards#570](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/570)
  - create file `Standards/scs-01xx-v1-dns.md` (a standard)
  - quote: "With this standard the SCS project aims to establish a baseline for reliable and consistent DNS features in SCS cloud environments."
  - this has been blocked by a change request since May 2024
  - unclear at first glance why @artificial-intelligence hasn't removed their change request
  - @mbuechse conjectures that the author @markus-hentsch didn't have the time to push this any more
  - it would be good to salvage this; who would be knowledgeable in these matters?
  - _AI @mbuechse: ask @markus-hentsch for an assessment of this PR_
- PR [standards#577](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/577)
  - create file `Standards/scs-XXXX-v1-time-sync-decisions.md` (a decision record)
  - again, this has been blocked by a change request by @artificial-intelligence, in this case, since September 2024
  - latest comment from October 2024: "I discussed the potential upstream topic with Neutron Team, and created an RFE issue for it. The topic will also be discussed during the PTG, it is currently scheduled for the 2014-10-24 15:00 - 16:00 UTC timeslot."
  - @mbuechse thinks we need to keep a record of the reasoning and decisions so far, even if more work is needed
  - maybe merge as draft, reach out to @artificial-intelligence and author @kgube
  - _AI @mbuechse: ask @kgube and @artificial-intelligence_
- more open PRs to be discussed later, including PRs for *better* preparing our test system for KaaS tests
    - Starting with syself autopilot as system under test
