### Housekeeping

#### Designate people to transfer minutes and report in community call

- @mbuechse

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @mbuechse and @fdobrovolny: move [issues/#332](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/332) forward_
    - (the KaaS hackathon probably took precedence)

### Agenda

#### New certificate scope versions for R6

sponsor: @mbuechse, timebox: 10 mins

Most of this is a report, but with a few questions at the end (marked Q).

- `scs-compatible-iaas` **v4**: stable since 2024-02-28 ðŸŽ‰
    - see [docs](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-compatible-iaas), [source](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Tests/scs-compatible-iaas.yaml)
    - so far, no CSP is compliant (but: first one to realize they have to add extra_specs, see [standards/#504](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/504))
        - [osism issue](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/899) open to enhance flavor-manager to add missing properties to *existing* flavors
    - CSPs have time to comply until v3 runs out, which will be by the end of 2024-04-30
    - it would be good to finish the [Compliance Monitor](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/381) well before then, so CSPs stay in the loop and feel the urgency
- `scs-compatible-kaas` **v1**: overdue, still pending ðŸ˜ž
    - see [docs](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-compatible-kaas), [source](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Tests/scs-compatible-kaas.yaml) (note: this also includes a v2 that is supposed to incorporate CNCF k8s conformance)
    - k8s version policy [test done](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/505); so far requires three running clusters (one for each active k8s branch)
    - k8s node distribution: Team Container [meeting on 2024-02-29](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/minutes/blob/main/container/20240229.md#tests-for-recently-stabilized-standards-mbuechse) found an issue with [the test](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/477)
        - the label used for the host name (`kubernetes.io/hostname`) refers to the kubelet, and not the physical host (it is probably set to the server hostname, but that is not the physical host either), therefore we can't validate [this assertion](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0214-v1-k8s-node-distribution#decision): "The control plane nodes MUST be distributed over multiple physical machines."
        - new issue [issues/#540](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/540) to augment the reference implementation so that the necessary information/label is provided
    - in general, our test relies on node labels that may or may not be set (though they seem to be in many cases)
        - new issue [standards/#494](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/494) to amend/replace the standard to accommodate for the node label requirements
- Q: How to proceed with the KaaS scope? Realistic timeline?
    - determine within the coming two weeks whether the CAPO solution is actually feasible
    - _AI @mbuechse or @cah-hbaum: work with Team Container to bring this forward_
    - _AI @jschoone: set up meeting with dNation experts_

#### SCS compliance monitor

sponsor: @mbuechse, timebox: 15 mins

- issue [standards/#381](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/381)
- work is progressing: we worked out the general architecture, the endpoints of the service etc.
    - preview (of work-in-progress) available at [PR standards/#500](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/500)
- Q: how to transform test results into statements about the subject's compliance? -- proposal:
    - tests generate samples, each one being a pair _(checked_at, result)_, where _result_ is one of
        - 1 (`pass`),
        - 0 (`DNF` or did not finish), or
        - -1 (`fail`)
    - convert this set of samples into a step function:
        - presume that the value from one sample to the next does not change
        - one exception: a `pass` is extended for at most 25 hrs; from 25 hrs past this sample to the next one counts as `DNF`
        - @fkr: is 24-hr cadence too often? --> discussion of its own
    - then we could say that, within some time window (looking back from today), there may at most be this many periods 'below 1', or such a period must be shorter than X, etc.
- Q: still I'm hesitant to automatically declare a subject non-conformant because of the possible fallout if it's actually our fault -- proposal:
    - manually annotate each period 'below 1' (potentially even divided into sub-periods) with information such as
        - defect in the cloud under test, and what kind
        - defect in the test
        - some procedural problems that are not the subject's fault
        - (ultimately, we only need the first one, together with a lower-bound estimate of its duration, and then we count the remainder as 1/`pass`)
    - and then we could indeed count the number of days that the cloud under test had clear defects
- decision: go ahead with manual annotation for the time being
    - let's hope we will some day arrive at the point where this manual work might overwhelm us :)
    - let's also hope that, by then, our tests are mature enough to warrant a more automated approach

#### SCS standards phases: deprecated vs. obsoleted

sponsor: @cah-hbaum

- PR [standards/#467](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/467)
- after looking into <https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html>, both states (deprecation and obsoletion) have their use-cases
- @garloff wants to keep things simple (number of states)
- @mbuechse suggests that we can handle both matters (inconsistent wording and additional states) independently
- Decision: make use of `Deprecated`, `deprecated_at` consistent, but don't add state `Obsolete` (yet)

#### SCS standards documents: Decision Record and Standards

sponsor: @cah-hbaum

- PR [standards/#441](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/441)
- had a talk with @mbuechse about this and made the section names not "REQUIRED" in some cases, but made such a section in general "REQUIRED"
- Q: do we separate DR and Standard documents into separate directories?
    - It used to be this way, then it was changed (maybe even upon request from C&H?).
    - Decision: Move this question into a separate issue (if still desired)
- Decision: in general, go ahead
