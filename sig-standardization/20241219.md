### Agenda

#### Bug in SCS-compatible IaaS v5

sponsor: @mbuechse

- contrary to intention, the standard scs-0123 did NOT get included properly
- the November minutes will show the original intention, but for the sake of transparency, use v5.1 moniker
- all parties who pass v5 will pass v5.1 (as far as we could test; exception: cc-rrze)
- postpone moving v4 to 'warn' by one month to allow providers to adjust to v5.1
- _AI @mbuechse: open PR, send to @garloff_

#### New column "country" @ Compliant cloud environments table

sponsor: @berendt (not sure if I can join on Thursday, feel free to discuss this anyway)

I want to add a new column "country" in the table of compliant cloud environments (https://docs.scs.community/standards/certification/overview/). I think this makes sense when we add the first cloud operated by a company not located in Germany. Probably this happens in a forseable time. With this column we are prepared for this case.

Discussion:

- What country should be used? Headquarter? Jurisdiction?
- Multiple flags, according to regions offered?
- Idea/proposal:
  - add flag to operator column (jurisdiction)
  - add column for regions with flag for each region
  - for the time being, put flag at the end of the line
