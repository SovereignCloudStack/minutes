### Next meetings (housekeeping)

sponsor: @mbuechse

- next two meetings collide with other meetings/conferences
  - 2025-09-25 (next week) SCS summit hangover; meeting of Forum SCS-Standards
  - 2025-10-02 Smart Country Convention
  - see PR [calendar#388](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/calendar/pull/388)
  - @depressiveRobot takes over meeting on 2025-10-02
- 2025-10-02 up until 2025-12-11, except 2025-10-30, I have other obligations on Thursdays
  - I can still prepare meetings
  - maybe we can find another slot (although last year that was unsuccessful)
  - let's try Tuesday 1005 for Q4/2025

### Communicating relaxed requirements

sponsor: @mbuechse

- we realized that certain testcases are not helpful, for both
  - OpenStack Powered Compute v2022.11 and
  - CNCF Kubernetes conformance
- for details, see issues [standards#990](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/990) and [standards#982](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/982), respectively
- when we decide that some testcases should be excluded for good reasons, we should properly document this in an accessible way, so customers of the certified products know what to expect
- suggestions:
  - create testing notes (not a formal Supplement because we can't set "supplements" field)
  - try to influence upstream so as to make our notes expendable
  - link to the testing notes instead of the original sources (they can in turn be linked to from the testing notes)
  - decision: yes to the above
  - add an asterisk (or some other marker) to each designation, i.e. "OpenStack Powered Compute v2022.11*" and "CNCF Kubernetes conformance*"
  - decision: rather append " (subset)"
- _AI @mbuechse_: implement decisions

### How is a SCS-compatible IaaS Offering certified?

sponsor: @fkr

- Together with @depressiveRobot we will showcase how we go through the process of an offering that has applied for certification
- for transparency, the (manual) process will be documented as another supplement to SCS-0004

### Clarification on [scs-0123 mandatory services](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0123-v1-mandatory-and-supported-IaaS-services) s3 expectations

sponsor: @toothstone (aka Friedrich)

The standard states that an s3 API has to be supplied, and to me the table layout implies that the OS service should be of the type "s3".

The test suite expects a service of type "object-store", i.e. Swift, to be present. [The endpoint URL is altered](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/e9174b028f267b795a8e75b64cbf00c060b7dca2/Tests/iaas/scs_0123_mandatory_services/mandatory_services.py#L103), contrary to the documentation requirements given by the standard:
> The endpoints of services MUST be findable through the catalog list of the identity APIÂ¹.

I would guess the tests were written under the assumption that CSPs would always use Swift to supply an s3 API, but the standard is not mandating that.

discussion:

- regarding potential S3-only entry in service catalog
  - ask openstack-discuss
  - ask public-cloud-sig
- make standard more concrete regarding that S3 and Swift work on the same data
  - Swift is not mandatory...
  - we could say in a supplement that it is indeed desirable to have shared data
  - we could also make it mandatory; yes, do this.
