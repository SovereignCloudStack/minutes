### Successor to OpenStack Powered Compute

sponsor: @fkr

- We need to talk about what the successor to the OpenStack Powered Compute looks like and even more important: when/how/if/who makes sure this happens
- related issues: [standards#990](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/990) and [standards#1010](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/1010)
- findings by partners
  - no fixed list of (Tempest) tests to be performed
    - open question: exclude admin tests?
  - apparently, the tests require further config (reference to a dubious flavor `flavor1` or `tempest1`)
  - Tempest not well received (not great to work with, just takes a lot to set up, even harder w/OSISM)
  - Would it be desirable to have the test integrated entirely into the SCS suite (preferably without Tempest to begin with)?
    - What about maintenance effort incurred by new code? (with new OpenStack releases etc.)
    - Could improving Tempest also be an option?
  - sometimes, Tempest can leak resources on failed tests (incomplete garbage collection)
    - potential problem if it is to be run regularly
    - but good for inspecting the failed tests
    - without admin credentials, one can just purge the respective project
- submitting results by tomorrow not feasible for many partners
  - this body (the SIG) cannot move the deadline (fkr/depressiveRobot to take this to Forum)
- partners by their own account should have contributed more to the SIG and pledge to do so in the future
- two partners offer capacity to work on integrating the test cases into the existing suite
- what partners currently use to validate well-working cloud:
  - OpenStack Health Monitor
    - deemed sufficiently complete, should be standard for SCS clouds
  - self-made API tests/checks
- [overview of testing tools](https://docs.openstack.org/self-healing-sig/latest/testing/tools-list.html)
- go ahead with [standards#1010](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/1010), provide better docs (as a community effort by those that do have conquered the beast)
  - for starters, restrict to non-admin tests
