### Agenda

#### `os_purpose` in scs-0102 (image metadata)

sponsor: @garloff

- Draft [PR standards/#970](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/970)
- Suggested stepwise approach:
  - Add `os_purpose` (and a few clarifications w.r.t. `os_distro` allowable values by pointing upstream) to existing v1 of scs-0102 (image metadata) *as recommendation* 
    - no new major version as no new hard requirement
    - Gather input from providers and users
    - Finalize `os_purpose` list v1 and merge soon
  - Add testing for this (for now producing only warnings)
  - Add field to [OpenStack image-manager input](https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/tree/main/etc/images)
  - Write blog article and reference it in impl notes
  - (Later) Create v2 of scs-0102 that requires `os_purpose` and v2 from scs-0104 (mandatory images) dropping the mandatory names.
  - Create a new SCS-compatible IaaS certification scope version referencing the new standards
- discussion:
  - image must be unique for `os_distro`/`os_version`/`os_purpose` AND `architecture`
  - is `os_purpose=network` really useful? (Or does it need to be more specific to be useful?)
  - new recommendations should create a new (minor) version number
  - try to get this merged by mid August, so we could have a stable v2 for 0102 und 0104 and include it in an SCS-compatible IaaS v6 in fall

#### Self-description of test subjects

sponsor: @mbuechse

- initial question: put IaaS-specific part into Nova [metadata service](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/metadata-service.html) to make accessing it super easy?
  - not an option, because this Nova metadata service is only accessible from an instance, not from the node that's running IaC
- option: add a service to the Keystone service catalog
  - prior work: spec of a [discoverability and constraint service](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/publiccloud-sig/+/909387/8/specs/discoverability_service.rst)
  - this is quite a lot of work and far away still
- option: use `clouds.yaml` profile
  - `clouds.yaml` with profile URL can be offered for download by Horizon
  - providers can add a vendor profile to `https://opendev.org/openstack/openstacksdk/src/branch/master/openstack/config/vendors`
    - alternatively, `profile` in `clouds.yaml` CAN be provided as URL of the form `$SCHEME://$NETLOC`
    - profile data will then be fetched from `$SCHEME://$NETLOC/.well-known/openstack/api`
  - profile data will be merged with `clouds.yaml` section
  - [code as documentation](https://opendev.org/openstack/openstacksdk/src/branch/master/openstack/config/vendors/__init__.py#L29)
  - would lead to one more HTTP(s) GET for every `openstack-cli` invocation
  - [schema](https://opendev.org/openstack/openstacksdk/src/branch/master/openstack/config/schema.json) already exists in OpenStack
  - only relevant for certain OpenStack services, not for Terraform
- option: use well-known URL scheme relative to Keystone URL
  - could be accomplished with suitable reverse proxy config
  - problem with Yaook: only keystone (pod) terminates TLS
- option: "abuse" Keystone service catalog
  - it seems tenable to just add such an URL (probably only the base path) to the service catalog even though it's not a "real" service (only supporting `GET`)
