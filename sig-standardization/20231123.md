    - DONE
- _AI @mbuechse: Add explanation to scs-0100 that server flavors with `i` and `z` should support images built for `x86_64`, `a` for `aarch64` and `r` is not yet listed for images in OpenStack)_
    - DONE

    - DONE

### Agenda

#### Collaboration SCS x ALASCA with respect to this SIG

- this SIG will be a joint effort by SCS and ALASCA, coordinated by Matthias BÃ¼chse
- open question:
    - how to best involve the ALASCA people -- will they use the same infrastructure (GitHub, mailing list), or do we need additional lists etc.?

#### Documentation progress

- [docs/#97](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/issues/97): Automate creation of standards overview pages
    - @mbuechse produced a working prototype under [PR docs/#116](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/116)
    - have a look at [docs-staging](https://docs-staging.scs.community/standards/standards/overview/)
    - revealed a few mistakes in the md files
        - wrong track field for 0412
        - missing track field, missing status field for 0100-v1
        - wrong type field for 0301
        - 'status' field erroneously called 'state' for 0002-v2
        - probably others?
    - _AI @mbuechse: write issue to add a Zuul check job to standards repo_
    - _AI @mbuechse: fix obvious mistakes; create issues for the rest_
    - open issues
        - improve icons (color coding is not optimal), improve columns in the overview table (line break between icon and standard shorthand is not optimal)
        - do not commit the generated content
    - _AI @mbuechse: parse front-matter as YAML and move introductory paragraph into individual md (use the latest stable for title/description, if any, otherwise latest); NOTE: type should be stable_

#### Processes for initial certification and continued compliance tracking

- [PR standards/#356](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/356) still open for review
- mention of Zuul nodepools has been dropped
    - rather demanding requirement for smaller CSPs
    - the main advantage (latency reduction) is really minor
    - alternatively, we can always create an instance in the environment under test and deploy+run our scripts there, if really necessary
- lifetime of the certificate status page (@fdobrovolny)
    - allow for reanimation of the page upon a new certification application (within 1 yr)
    - after revokation/expiration keep page online for at least 3 months (then remove upon request)
    - _AI @mbuechse: extend text accordingly_
