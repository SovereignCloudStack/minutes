### Agenda

#### Welcome

This SIG is now a joint effort between [SCS](https://scs.community) and [ALASCA](https://alasca.cloud), with @mbuechse serving as the coordinator.

#### New certificate subject _SCS-compatible KaaS_

- KaaS-related tests will be implemented using (or, in one case, ported to) Sonobuoy, expect first results soon
- @cah-hbaum and @mbuechse agreed that it's worth waiting until then

#### Low attendance today

- invite to a special installment next week (because otherwise, we only have Dec 14th before the year is out)
- maybe institute some kind of RSVP system or use a Doodle?
