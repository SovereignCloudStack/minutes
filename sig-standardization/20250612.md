  - opened issue [standards#930](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/930)
  - closed old issue [standards#662](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/662) and PR [standards#675](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/745), which referred to scs-0211-v1
- AI @mbuechse: make sure that image names are no longer fixed by scs-0104-v1 
  - opened issue [standards#933](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/933)

### Agenda

#### Potentially move our meeting to another time slot

sponsor: @mbuechse

- proposal
  - change timeslot to *Thursday 10:05 CE(S)T*
  - skip whenever it would collide with Lean SCS Operator Coffee (every four weeks)
- no majority for a change

#### Adjustments to scs-0001 and addition of scs-0007

sponsor: @fkr

- proposed changes to scs-0001-v1:
  - we want to invite Forum SCS Standards to use our standardization framework
  - however, they need to retain some control
  - give Forum SCS Standards special veto rights when a global procedural is being stabilized
  - specifically: amend "phase transition" from Draft to Stable for Global track: at least one person who represents the Forum has to approve the PR (potentially next to other people)
- case in point -- introduce [scs-0007-v1](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/946) (draft):
  - regulations for certifying integrators

#### Re-engineer testcases and result handling (FYI)

sponsor: @mbuechse

- we couldn't discuss this topic last time for lack of time
- I moved the extensive notes that I had prepared into an issue: [standards#951](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/951)
- in the meantime, I managed to make a "final draft" of how I envision the [new format of `scs-compatible-iaas.yaml`](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/feat/rework_testcases/Tests/scs-compatible-iaas.yaml)

#### Standard images standard: stop enforcement

sponsor: @mbuechse

- I hereby make a motion for a moratorium on the enforcement of scs-0104-v1.
  - last time we have already recognized that the standard is worthy of improvement content-wise
  - the standard is also problematic the way it is implemented, and it severely impedes improvements with respect to testcase handling
  - not enforcing the standard will not help any test subject become compliant (the only subjects this would affect at all have trouble with lots of other testcases)
- discussion
  - this course of action means we don't have a good migration path from v1 to v2 of the standard
  - it's well possible that during the moratorium some applications break because an environment fails the requirements, without us noticing
  - proposal: do v2 first (maybe soon), then we don't have a gap, but design it in a way that it can also be used as a replacement for v1

#### Compliance Score and Aggregated Compliance Score

sponsor: @mbuechse

- issue [standards#950](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/950)
  - compliance score: show people by how much compliance is missed (score below 100, depending on no. of failed required test cases) or even overachieved (score above 100, depending on number of passed recommended test cases)
    - recommended test cases are only counted if all required ones are passed!
  - aggregated score: linear combination of this week's compliance score (say, from Friday noon if that's in the past, otherwise the most recent one) with last week's aggregated score (initialize with compliance score), cf. [Unix-style load average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing)#Unix-style_load_calculation)
- discussion
  - why? --> simplify assessment at a glance (w/o need to look at details page), facilitate selection process for potential customers, gamification/motivation for CSPs
  - however, what CSPs need first and foremost is demand for SCS-compliant offerings
  - for customers, it could be more suitable to offer an online questionnaire about what they deem important, and then to rank the table according to the preferences
  - table this topic for now
