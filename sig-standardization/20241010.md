### Agenda

#### HedgeDoc blunder

sponsor: @mbuechse

- I broke this document, apparently by pressing F9 or something
- it was too big for "undo" to work properly
- I could only restore the last three meetings
- however, I swear we always transferred the minutes correctly!!!
- find all our minutes here: [link to folder in minutes repo](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/minutes/tree/main/sig-standardization)
- _AI @mbuechse to check from revisions whether any session is missing in github minutes repo_

#### Decision record: keep CAPI images recommended

sponsor: @mbuechse

- please [approve](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/582)
    - @frosty-geek has approved, but a second one wouldn't hurt
    - looks good to @garloff ;)

#### Facilitator for Oct 17 and Oct 24

sponsor: @mbuechse

- Who wants to do it?
    - send invitation e-mail
    - chair the meeting
- Discussion
    - Oct 24 to take place with @garloff as chair
    - Oct 17 (without @garloff, @gtema, @mbuechse) free for self organization (if you need Jitsi credentials ask @garloff)
    - _AI @mbuechse: remove Oct 17 from calendar_

#### Standards roadmap until end of November

sponsor: @mbuechse

- mostly report
- SCS-compatible KaaS v1 will be done
    - with CNI standard
    - with Zuul job that can work on multiple KaaS implementations using a plugin approach
    - with tests for those standards that are currently in the main branch
- IaaS
    - See [standards/#718](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/718)
    - try to finalize GPU naming [standards#366](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/366)

#### Side discussion: GPU flavor naming

- issue: [standards#366](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/366)
- for November, try to remain compatible with current major version
- include VRAM into name
- include instructive table into document
- main use-case: GPGPU (CUDA) for AI
- second use-case: GPGPU (CUDA) for HPC
- negligible use-cases: raytracing and other graphics-related stuff
