### Agenda

#### Potential ambiguity/mismatch/inconsistency between [scs-0001-v1-sovereign-cloud-standards](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0001-v1-sovereign-cloud-standards.md) and [scs-0003-v1-sovereign-cloud-standards-yaml](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0003-v1-sovereign-cloud-standards-yaml.md) -- @mbuechse
* initial understanding/questions
    * What does it mean when we say that _a set of standards is stabilized_? Is it
        * the set is fixed, but the individual standards can still change (and therefore, they have their individual stabilization date),
        * is it the other way around (but then why the individual dates?), or
        * is it both? Or none of that?
    * Each time we introduce a new version of some standard, do we copy the whole set of standards from the previous version and only change this one standard? (As is about to happen with [this PR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/294))
        * This approach makes sense from a certification perspective, but we get to v100 before we have gathered a considerable amount of standards, so maybe use a dedicated "playground" namespace (i.e., call it "SCS compatible WIP") for the time being?
* Clarification by Alex: versioning of individual standards is not relevant to certification; what's relevant for certification is a bundle of standards, so to speak, and these bundles are versioned
* --> AI @mbuechse: Write an article for the docs page summarizing the certification process for the wider audience


#### Track standardization progress -- @mbuechse
* data from Kurt's ALASCA talk has been converted into a [HedgeDoc](https://input.scs.community/tqKlv1Z_Srmi5e5o76CxhQ?view) and also updated according to current progress
* feedback from Kurt and Felix was that they would like to work with epics
* the IaaS part has been converted into an [epic](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/285)
* the CaaS part seems to already have an [epic](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/181), but there is some discrepancy with the HedgeDoc -- see [comparison table](https://nextcloud.cloudandheat.com/s/kLQCB3We7miCwcG)

* --> We will move this discussion to the next SIG Standardization Meeting in two weeks, where Kurt will be back. Alex to point Kurt. What is in the epic is not 100% in line with the actual table (see ALASCA talk)
