Certification Document to be handed out at SCS Summit
NFT Certifcates?! 

Expiry date 7 months? 
Hard coded validity related to the deprecation date in the version yaml. 
Technically may be realized by a ssl certificate

Continuous certification ...
- Require regular telemetry data (every day, every month, ....) -> needs to be automated (git?)
