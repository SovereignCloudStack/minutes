#### Open pull requests

sponsor: @mbuechse

- [standards#522](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/522) "standardizing IPv4 networking in SCS"
  - PR in draft state (to prevent accidental merge)
  - issue [issues#167](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/167)
  - seems to me like it has been abandoned, quote
    - "For the record, that topic was discussed recently in a SCS IaaS meeting, initiated by kgube. **One of the questions was, if we want to define all network topics in one single network standard and the answer was clearly a no.** Next we will figure out what network aspect will get its own standard document and what aspect might still be missing."
  - decision: close PR
- [standards#572](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/572) "Add standard for provider networks"
  - not formally linked to any issue, but as per comment, it's related to issue [issues#167](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/167) as well
  - so I guess it's like a follow-up to the #522 above
  - final comment "LGTM only tests are missing." by josephineSei
  - _AI @fkr: reach out to three CSPs to ask whether they will implement standard from PR 572_ (UhuruTec, Syseleven, Plusserver)
  - Tests need to be created (open position at Forum SCS-Standards)
