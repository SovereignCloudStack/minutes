### Bug squashing fest

sponsor: @fkr/@depressiveRobot

- Together we want to squash issues and PRs in the many SCS repositories on November 18th between 11am and 3pm
- We'll meet here: https://conf.scs.koeln:8443/SCS-Tech

### SCS-0007 Integrator exceptions

sponsor: @depressiveRobot

- [Continuation of the discussion](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/minutes/blob/main/sig-standardization/20251014.md#scs-0007-integrator-exceptions)
- main focus of SCS-0007 is on the operational capability of the providers
- preferred solution is to introduce a one-year "Incubator status" certification with the goal to meet the criteria for the Integrator certification after that year
  - problem: criteria require one year of successful operation
  - relax criteria: either one year in operation or successfully put into operation during "Incubator status"
- rename "exception" to "Incubator status"
- _AI @depressiveRobot will create draft_

### Integrator certification process docs missing

sponsor: @toothstone (AKA Friedrich)

Moved to https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/1005

- integrator documentation missing
- need for more information at https://docs.scs.community/standards/certification/overview/ and "Scopes and Versions" subpage
  - maybe also additional graphics and menu items
- _AI @depressiveRobot will create draft_

### Contribute feedback to Deutschland-Stack

sponsor: @mbuechse

- [landscape](https://deutschland-stack.gov.de/landkarte) as currently proposed completely missing IaaS layer and lifecycle management
- we except multiple parties to [petition](https://deutschland-stack.gov.de/beteiligung) this, but it doesn't hurt to put together dedicated feedback on behalf of the SIG
- for instance: it would be sad if the existing and proven efforts (to a very large extent funded by the German state) would be neglected
- there is already input from OSBA, SCS and ALASCA

### Clarification on OpenStack Powered Compute certification requirements

sponsor: @toothstone (AKA Friedrich)

- refstackclient is de facto defunct - what proof does the certification body expect of CSPs, that they actually passed the tests?
- on 2025-07-10 it was decided to "For now: create an SCS tempest test list and invite others to join" but no AI
  - I have several scripts to parse the Interop/refstack-JSON into tempest regexes (for either `tempest run --include-list` or `--regex`)
  - I have a list of the matching tests in the format that tempest recognizes for the `tempest run --load-list` option
  - a "reference" Yaook TempestJob manifest for SCS-IaaS compliance testing is WIP, it would be easiest if SCS supplies a machine readable definition of the expected tests in regex or load-list format for that. What about OSISM?
- replace link (https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-compatible-iaas) to additional implementation note how to run subset of OpenStack Powered Compute using tempest
- _AI @depressiveRobot and @toothstone will create implementation note draft_
  - @fzakfeld will share his insights

### Clarification on S3 and mandatory service definitions

sponsor: @toothstone (AKA Friedrich)

Moved to https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/1004

- need for clear wording and requirements list what has to be done/what is expected in the catalog
- test suite currently in contradiction to scs-0123, for example tests for Swift as mandatory
- test is using sub-URL of Swift service URL to discover S3 service for testing
  - need for way to discover S3 (and other) services
- feature sets for S3 currently unclear and not well-defined
  - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/1003
- _AI @toothstone will bring this topic into next Lean SCS Operator Coffee_
