### Agenda

#### Glossary

- goal: refine concepts, try to be as simple as possible
    - case in point: in our discussions, we regularly confuse 'standard' and 'certification', sometimes also 'level' and 'layer'
    - we are also missing a agreed-upon name for the concept of certification bundle/set/package
- first shot at glossary: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/320>
    - to be incorporated into <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/blob/main/glossary.md>
- discuss [remarks by Matthias](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/320#pullrequestreview-1513314605)
    - Levels and layers are independent, indeed (we will always certify layers independently, but they may share standards, theoretically even 100 %)
    - Standards belong to a track (not a layer)
    - ADR process, with three types of docs (DRs, Stds, Procedural)
    - No better term for "certification bundle" yet
    - "SCS-compliant" is not defined. Compliant with "SCS-compatible" on IaaS layer is well-defined.

#### Visualizations

- Certification timeline
    - helpful for general explanation
    - but also for showing the current status quo (what's valid right now)
    - need some special case for current "anomaly" (more than two cert bundles valid)
- Certification bundles timetable
    - more details with respect to contents
    - also works for current "anomaly"
- --> AD to work in Figma to create a sketch of the standards homepage

#### Processes

- How does a certification bundle evolve over time?
    - We want only one version to be active at any given time, except for the grace/transition period (6 weeks max), when the old and the new version are both active.
        - YES
    - Once a version is stabilized (becomes active), we set the date for the next one (somewhat far ahead in the future).
        - Hard to predict when the need for a new version would arise. However, we might have "at least valid until" dates that may then be extended...
    - Stabilization of a version requires a dedicated vote
        - in particular, it cannot be voted upon together with stabilization of a standard!
        - YES
    - --> MB to write a Procedural
