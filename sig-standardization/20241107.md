### Housekeeping

#### Designate people for chores

- minute taking: @garloff
- minutes transfer: @mbuechse
- community call: @garloff

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @mbuechse: doodle the workshop date, e.g., two blocks of 90 minutes_
    - cancelled?

### Agenda

#### Understand the standards that should be fixed for KaaS

sponsor: @janiskemper

- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/615
    - Standardize k8s networking policies (CNI) [#769](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/769)
    - [Standard] CNCF conformance tests [#709](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/709)
    - [Standard] Node distribution v2 [#494](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/494)
        - [Standard] Stabilize node distribution standard [#639](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/639)
    - [Standardization] KaaS Robustness features issues [#414](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/414)
    - Update Standard "Baseline K8s Cluster Security" - rename to "K8s cluster hardening" [#475](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/475)
    - [Standard] A simple, usable default StorageClass should be available in Kubernetes clusters [#652](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/652)
- Testing ...
    - [Feature Request] Implement tests for scs-0210-v2, scs-0214-v1 [#481](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/481)
    - [Feature Request] add Implementation Notes to scs-0214-v2 (as Supplement) [#535](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/535)
    - ...
- Process discussion
    - SCS-compatible should serve users that search for interoperability and robustness guarantees
    - Not all standards (or test instructions or ADRs) that are stable need to become part of a certification scope
        - Certainly not if they don't serve the users
        - Some may be deferred for a later revision
    - Will send list to mailing list for review
        - Operators
        - Technology implementors


#### KaaS Networking/NetworkPolicy standardization

sponsor: @kgube

- PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/789
- needs reviews/feedback
- current requirements:
    - CSP MUST provide CNI plugin with NetworkPolicy support
    - CSP SHOULD choose CNI plugin where there is ongoing work to add AdminNetworkPolicy support
    - CSP SHOULD offer option for managed Ingress
        - is this out of scope for the standard?
    - CSP MAY add default network policies (e.g. blocking metadata, isolating namespaces)
- compliance testing:
    - If we only mandate NetworkPolicy we can reuse the upstream e2e tests with sonobuoy

Discussion:

- SHOULD is a strong recommendation in RFC language, still OK here
- Let's keep it together as one standard, may split it up in the future
- Standard is good to go, please approve, @jschoone :-)
- Several ways to provide ingress, may come completely from Infra (OpenStack amphorae), but this may not be the most robust and resource efficient way. Still good to have many options, e.g. combining ovn LB from Infra with nginx-ingress or Gateway API from cilium CNI. Hints could end up in implementation and testing notes companion doc
- Overview over what common CNIs provide would also be useful in the implementation and testing notes companion doc
