### Documentation of implementing certificate scopes

sponsor: @fkr

- We have outdated blog posts, such as [the one from C&H](https://scs.community/2024/05/13/cost-of-making-an-openstack-cluster-scs-compliant/)
- I think it is important to have (somewhere in our docs, not in a blog post) a how-To on implementing the standards on an environment
- However there is the valid concern about the depth of this how-to, in order to not have outdated docs the minute we adjust small bits
- there is already an issue for that: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/issues/213
- we assume already-competent user, so it should be a how-to rather than a tutorial (https://www.diataxis.fr/tutorials-how-to/)
- how-to check and establish compliance of a vanilla OpenStack (IaaS) as a starting point with the help of the existing tools
  - how to get test suite running
  - how to get OpenStack Compute running (needs ready-to-use basis)
  - supplements (implementation notes) of a concrete standard should describe what specifically needs to be configured and how
  - mention various implementations (OSISM, Yaook) and link to their documentation only
- issues with SCS Health Monitor raised
  - currently not a replacement for old implementation
  - _AI @chrisschwa creates issue with description of problems_

### Bug squashing fest immediately afterwards

sponsor: @fkr/@depressiveRobot

- Together we want to squash issues and PRs in the many SCS repositories today between 11am and 3pm (lunch break around 12am)
- We'll meet here: https://conf.scs.koeln:8443/SCS-Tech

### Contribute feedback to Deutschland-Stack

sponsor: @mbuechse/@depressiveRobot

- What could the specific focus and additional value be of a statement in addition to the ones of OSBA, SCS and ALASCA?
- mbuechse: Main point could be "it would be sad if the existing and proven efforts (to a very large extent funded by the German state) would be neglected" (if that is already covered by the others, then maybe drop the whole thing)
- _AI @fkr adds hint to various regular meetings (SIG Std/Cert, Lean SCS Operator Coffee, SCS Community Meeting, Container Team) to SCS statement_

### K8S Certification / Supported Vendors

sponsor: @chrisschwa

- How to add [k0smotron](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0smotron) as one of the possible products for SCS compliant K8S
- general approach is to use the KaaS compliance test suite to validate SCS compliance of k0smotron
  - at the moment not part of the documentation (currently only available for IaaS): https://docs.scs.community/standards/certification/pipeline
- first, we need to get KaaS compliance tests running
  - see https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/982
- secondly, expansion of the documentation for KaaS
