### Housekeeping

#### Designate people to transfer minutes and report in community call

- @mbuechse

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @anjastrunk: Create issues regarding C&H implementation (one epic issue and separate issues for each standard)_
    - done: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/426>
- _AI @mbuechse and @fdobrovolny: move [issues/#332](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/332) forward_
    - open
- _AI @mbuechse: write an issue to draft Implementation and Testing Notes additional accompanying document as a kind of preview of what this could look like_
    - done: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/437>
- _AI @mbuechse: use four columns (with asterisk for explanation)_
    - done
- _AI @mbuechse: write an issue to add some (redundant) color coding with appropriate contrast ratios_
    - done: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/445>

### Agenda

#### Minor addendum to Hackathon Recap

- The idea of a portability-test tool wasn't new, see [standards/#313](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/313)

#### Stabilize scs-0003-v1: Sovereign Cloud Standards YAML?

- [scs-0003-v1](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0003-v1-sovereign-cloud-standards-yaml/): Sovereign Cloud Standards YAML
- Draft PR [standards/391](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/391)
- When to stabilize? What's missing?
    - Maybe wait for [standards/#437](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/437)?
    - Please review [standards/#443](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/443)

#### scs-0004-v1: Achieving certification

- [PR standards/#356](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/356) still open for review
- more details regarding air-gapped scenarios (mail from Enrico)
    - be more specific: how to deliver logs?
    - getting logs out of the cloud _daily_ won't be feasible
    - consensus: if weekly delivery isn't feasible, then the cloud in question probably is out of our scope
- revisit the matter of certificate validity period (@fdobrovolny)
    - either until the expiration date of the certification scope
    - or for a few months only, and the next cert is handed out if and when the manual checks will have been passed?
    - consensus: let's try the former option and change it if necessary; the scope is usually valid for 6 months only anyway

#### New certificate scope versions

- slated for this quarter
    - target February
- see [preliminary list](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/minutes/blob/main/sig-standardization/20230824.md#r5-standards-iaas-v4-container-v1) (from 2023-08-24)
- [scs-compatible-iaas.yaml](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/issue/316/Tests/scs-compatible-iaas.yaml) with draft v4, PLUS maybe
    - scs-0101-v1 Entropy: tests still depend on environment
    - scs-0112-v1 Volume Types: work in progress
    - ...
    - NB: DNS/NTP might be finished in time, but they might require bigger changes from implementors/CSPs --> keep this in mind, maybe start with recommendations
- scs-compatible KaaS v1
    - scs-0210-v1 (or even v2?) K8s version recency (yes v2 would be good)
    - scs-0211-v1 KaaS default storage class
    - scs-0212-v1 Requirements for container registry (only a Decision Record, but a Standard is being worked on)
    - scs-0213-v1 K8s node anti-affinity (only a Decision Record: 0214 is the real one)
    - scs-0214-v1 K8s node distribution
    - scs-0216-v6 Requirements for testing cluster-stacks
    - Baseline security, cluster robustness etc.? (hopefully done until february)
    - still open: Sonobuoy for testing (probably just give it a try: research by doing)

#### How to test and visualize different RFC 2119 keywords in SCS standards

- See [standards/#402](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/402)
- Write a kind of howto for <https://docs.scs.community/dev-docs>
    - _AI @mbuechse: write an issue and assign it to @cah-patrickthiem_
- For things that are not clear by this general howto, clarify in the per-standard supplementary document

#### where do we place Tang/Clevis

(not discussed, because the sponsor wasn't present; moved to next meeting)

#### Differentiation between DR and Standards moving forward

- See [standards/pull/#441](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/441)
- Please REVIEW
