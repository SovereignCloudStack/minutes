### SCS-0007 Integrator exceptions

sponsor: @depressiveRobot

- worries
  - too many requests for exceptions may undermine the quality perception of integrator certification
  - some Gestalters had problems to vote due to assessment of references or don’t know requesting organization
  - no clear criteria how to rate exception references (hard checkable facts)
- opinions
  - standards vs. flexibility
    - customers expect standards to be fulfilled
    - flexibility to allow (new) companies to qualify and be able to acquire customers requesting SCS compatibility (chicken-egg problem)
  - fact-checked reasoning
    - exceptions should be based on hard checkable facts
    - exceptions should be time-limited
      - supplement already states, that exceptions should be eliminated until re-certification
    - prevent exceptions from becoming a risk to trust
  - many suggestions on lowering initial requirements
    - alternative entry level certificate like "Incubator" or "Bronze" status
  - defined process with strict criteria to ensure quality and transparency
    - roadmap on how exceptions will be eliminated
    - counteract potential social pressure
- proposal
  - make requirements more generic for the first year
  - allow companies with relevant experience (like OpenStack) to qualify while they work towards full SCS compliance
- inputs of this meeting
  - integrators should always work towards building SCS-compatible clouds
  - entry level certification only once
  - allow companies that don't want to offer an own public cloud (criteria c) to get certification
  - how do we want to handle joint references? (e.g. two or more companies have jointly set up SCS clouds or manage them together)

### Add larger memory flavors

sponsor: @mbuechse

- PR [standards#938](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/938) now ready for review
- Q: do we need that many flavors, or can we drop those with root disk?
  - suggestion to drop those with root disk
  - recommend meaningful and uniform disk sizes as explanation in the standard
- AI: @garloff will create a proposal/draft

### Create v2 of scs-0102-image-metadata

sponsor: @mbuechse

- draft PR [standards#988](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/988)
  - makes `os_purpose` mandatory
  - removes naming convention
- while we're at it, what else do we want to change?
- open question how fast we want to make this mandatory
  - maybe tie such things in the future to SCS releases
- _AI @depressiveRobot_ will ask all providers whether a prompt activation of the new requirements is feasible for them in short term in order to stay compliant
