### Agenda

#### Presentation of standards - docs - page draft with structure and content

- Alex presents 
- Question: how do we align this with the content created by Matthias
- Main difference: certificate subject vs. certificate type
    - vote: 6 for subject, 1 for type, 4 abstain
    - ergo, we will use the term "subject"
    - AI @mbuechse: update the document scs-0003 accordingly

#### New certificate versions: IaaS v4, CaaS v1

- see <https://input.scs.community/#R5-standards-IaaS-v4-Container-v1> for the list
- talk again about the list
    - beginning of October
    - AI @mbuechse: take the lead
- target date for stabilization: 2023-12-01
- check AI from last time: set up meeting(s) to prioritize tasks within Epics [#285](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/285) and [#181](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/181)
    - still do it after R5

#### Certification application/issuance process [standards/#337](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/337)

- @mbuechse created issue based on extant [PR239](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/239) and the comments contained therein
- multiple open questions so far, e.g.,
    - contribute nodepools for Zuul?
    - what about test failure or other violation (after the cert has been issued)?

#### Certificate development process [issues/#343](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/343)

- @mbuechse and @anjastrunk would prefer one yaml file per ~~type of certificate~~ certificate subject instead of per level
- discussion has been on hold since [2023-06-29](https://input.scs.community/2023-scs-sig-standardization#2023-06-29)
- vote: 7 for, 1 against, 3 abstain
- AI @mbuechse: adjust documents accordingly
- AI @mbuechse: also add language to scs-0003 that CSPs (and all stakeholders) should be invited to the meeting that we hold a vote on


#### Voting as a means of reaching a decision

- @garloff: we had two votes today; consensus agreement would be much preferred
- view vote more like an opinion poll, leave possibility open for veto if so desired by a passionate party
