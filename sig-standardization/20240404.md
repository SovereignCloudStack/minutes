### Housekeeping

#### Designate people to transfer minutes and report in community call

- @martinmo

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @mbuechse and @fdobrovolny: move [issues/#332](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/332) forward_
    - open
- _AI @mbuechse: write issue to add Implementation Notes Supplement_ for node distribution standard
    - done: [standards/#535](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/535)
- _AI @mbuechse: set up meeting with @artificial-intelligence_ regarding CfP for OpenInfra day 2024
    - done: we met on 2024-03-22, handed in our proposal on 2024-03-26

### Agenda
 
#### refining the CVE check for the version policy script (scs-0210-v2)

sponsor: @martinmo

- corresponding issue: [#526](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/526)
- FYI: in today's Team Container meeting,
  - I surveyed whether an approach using the `trivy` vuln scanner is acceptable (answer: yes) and
  - we also discussed alternatives to that approach
  - we agreed that I'll do a MVP with trivy, fallback to nvdlib if that doesn't work out

#### Create v2 of node distribution standard

sponsor: @martinmo + @cah-hbaum

- [PR #524](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/524) has `stabilized_at` today
- Is it ready to merge? Approvals needed!
- Merge as draft instead of stable because, as of now, the time horizon for an implementation in KaaS (v2) is unclear (depends on upstream)
- if this situation remains unchanged in the next two weeks, maybe introduce an intermediate version that demotes some of the points to recommendations for the time being

#### Alternative LB (@markus-hentsch)

- Octavia alternative (?): https://github.com/stackitcloud/yawol/
- related: [issues/#528](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/528): Define a list of mandatory and of optional (supported) SCS OpenStack services
    - current list: https://input.scs.community/list-of-required-recommended-and-optional-openstack-projects#
    - LBaaS at least supported, maybe will land in mandatory
- Q: can/should we evaluate it in the context of VP10 with the aim to include yawol as a supported alternative during the Yaook SCS setup with KaaS?
- A:
    - Octavia will most likely be moved to mandatory in the list, because the KaaS reference implementation of SCS depends on it
        - when ingress etc. is created in Kubernetes, a LB is automatically created using Octavia's API
    - Octavia covers both IaaS and KaaS, it offers LBaaSv2 API and is also integrated into the KaaS layer
        - yawol seems to be limited to Kubernetes/KaaS layer, judging from the documentation
        - yawol does not seem to cover the IaaS layer and API to the same extent and is therefore not a drop-in replacement for Octavia
    - hence, CSPs cannot omit Octavia when deploying yawol because yawol does not fully cover the IaaS layer with the LBaaSv2 API

#### code license in the standards repo

sponsor: @mbuechse/@artificial-intelligence

- last time, we concluded that
    - CC-BY-SA-4.0 works for scripting languages
    - the license is specified for the entirety of the repo
- Q: what other licenses do we want to permit?
    - for compiled languages
    - for different taste
    - for contributions that have a more permissive license to begin with
    - A: see scs website: AGPL for instance, or Apache if better suited to some ecosystem
- Q: shall we additionally put in the spdx-line in every script?
    - "explicit is better than implicit"
- Q: shall this be checked automatically?
    - check again in 6 weeks
