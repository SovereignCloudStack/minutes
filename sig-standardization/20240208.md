### Agenda

:rotating_light: NOTE: topics that don't mention the sponsor/author/presenter will not be discussed.


#### New certificate scope versions for February

sponsor: @mbuechse (sick, but will likely be substituted for by others?)

- [scs-compatible-iaas.yaml](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Tests/scs-compatible-iaas.yaml) with draft v4
    - scs-0101-v1 Entropy: now stable
    - scs-0103-v1 Standard Flavors and Properties: now stable
    - scs-0104-v1 Standard Images: not yet stable
        - conformance tests don't yet check whether images can be uploaded to Glance
            - Can not even be fully tested as we do not want to upload the whole limit on every test
        - maybe postpone (move to a draft v5)
        - reasoning:
            - In the standard there is a requirement to be able to upload 40 images per 100 GB, Operators were not aware of this limit, currently there are no quotas in place.
            - When we allow customers to upload their custom images we do not have to support a multitude of images.
            - We want to propose that custom images have to be possible however there should be some fair use limitations, as this should not be abused.
        - Customers can snapshot running VMs therefore the limit has to be so it is possible
        - Two workflows:
            - Bring your own image
            - Snapshot running VM
        - @fkr Proposal: Remove hard limits from the standard and mention just fair use policy
        - Solution for Snapshoting will be discussed later
    - VOTE: shall this draft be declared stable (probably after moving scs-0104-v1 to a draft v5)
- scs-compatible KaaS v1
    - scs-0210-v2 K8s version recency (NOTE: v2) (https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/466)
        - Done and should be included
    - scs-0214-v1 K8s node distribution (https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/465) HA and recomendation for power outage
        - Without objections
    - VOTE: shall this list of standards make up a new v1 in a new `scs-compatible-kaas.yaml`? (it will have to be declared stable in a separate step, but that should be a formality)
    - This will be revisited next round in two weeks when the standards are stable


#### Differentiation between DR and Standards moving forward

sponsor: @cah-hbaum

- [standards/#441](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/441)
- This spawns from the idea that standards and decision records should be more differentiated, this propably should be achieved by moving them into a different location and different structure.
- @fkr: Would be nice to bring this into the Comunity Weekly call as well to get a broder audience
- @cah-hbaum: Will be revisited with @mbuechse next week


#### Standards housekeeping

sponsor: @cah-hbaum

- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/467 (Housekeeping)
- Naming "obsoleted_at" and "deprecated_at" is inconsistent
> `obsoleted_at`  | REQUIRED if `status` is `Deprecated` 
- next time ask @mbuechse if there was a reason behind this
- @all - Would be nice to get more reviews
- @martinmo: In his understanding there seems there might be two distinct stages `deprecation` ans `obsoletion`
> Deprecation phase (Deprecated)
> Should a document become obsolete, it can be deprecated.
> Obsoletions SHOULD be announced ahead of their execution by setting the deprecated_at
- A standard becomes deprecated at the point when a new standard replaces it, can become obsolate before this point.
- @cah-hbaum: Will contact @mbuechse to propably update the first standard to reflect this better


#### License Considerations

sponsor: @maxwolfs

- https://docs.scs.community/community/license-considerations
- From SIG Community discussion: Should this be converted to an ADR? It seems somewhat lost at this place
- @fkr: In the standards draft page there are some more documents that it might make sense to move into the docs page as well -> This could be an ADR, definitely does not make sense to have it as a random document in docs page
- The license-considarions is a recomendation not a requirement
- @artifical-inteligence: some parts seems like they could be make into legally binding for SCS such as we will not change the licensing, this can be as next step to split this document into not just an ADR
- OUTPUT: We move this page into an ADR and add to documentation all the ADRs, as part of the PR @artifical-inteligence concerns can be addressed as well.
