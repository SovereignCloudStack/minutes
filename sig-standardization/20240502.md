### Housekeeping

#### Designate people to transfer minutes and report in community call

- @markus-hentsch

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @mbuechse and @fdobrovolny: move [issues/#332](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/332) forward_
    - open
- _AI: put license topic on agenda for May 16_
    - open (keep until then)

### Agenda 

#### Make CAPI images mandatory

sponsor: @mxmxchere / @jschoone

- see [standards/#569](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/569)
- will save time and money for both CSP and customer
- would guarantee quality and timelness of image
- regardless of CSP taste, this KaaS tech is part of SCS
- CSP won't have noticable disadvantages from providing the image
- _AI @martinmo: add requirement that the image should be recent (see k8s version policy standard)_
    - mention implementation notes
- _AI @mxmxchere: write (short) DR on this and then change image def yaml (new version => draft, and then stabilize)_


#### Taxonomy of Failsafe Levels

sponsor: @josephineSei

- First discussion lead to further research whether something like this already exists
    - there is some regulations from the BSI, but no separation into levels or classes
- see [standards/#527](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/527)
- hard to research existing nomenclature
    - often you find cybersecurity content, which doesn't apply here
    - or you land on some shill site
- comments from the group
    - very useful -- double-check that we don't replicate work that already has addressed this well
    - maybe BSI -- [this](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Standards-und-Zertifizierung/IT-Grundschutz/Zertifizierte-Informationssicherheit/IT-Grundschutzschulung/Online-Kurs-Notfallmanagement/4_RisikenAnalysieren/1_Risiken%20identifizieren/RisikenIdentifizieren_node.html) or [this](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Hochverfuegbarkeit/BandG/G7_HV-Prinzipien.html?nn=408794) or [this](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Grundschutz/Kompendium/Elementare_Gefaehrdungen.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4) -- could be a source? but could also be too elaborate or complicated for us, so we may still need to merge certain categories
    - check back with BSI? maybe we can earn some kind of approval from them
- another round of discussion would be good
    - among other topics, talk about a version for the KaaS layer
    - use spillover slot on Monday at 15:05 CE(S)T
    - _AI @josephineSei: write mail to list with specific date where there's no conflict with lean operator coffee or similar_

#### Handling of (newly) obsolete code paths in check scripts

sponsor: @mbuechse (inspired by @cah-hbaum)

- see [standards/#578](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/578)
- definitely wait until we no longer want to check the old version (sometimes we allow for an extended usage of older versions)
- after some sufficiently long period, when we refactor/clean up the scripts, we may also remove obsolete code paths
- general idea: if there is a significant change from one major version of the standard to the next, also make a new version of the test script
