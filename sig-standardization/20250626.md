### Housekeeping

#### Check AIs from last time

- amend scs-0001-v1 to involve Forum SCS-Standards for Global documents
  - see PR [standards#954](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/954); merged!
  - _AI add language that the SIG can act as fallback in case one of the teams is not active_

### Agenda

#### Deprecate SCS-compatible IaaS v4

sponsor: @mbuechse

- it's high time
- PR [standards#955](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/955)
- got merged live
- _AI @mbuechse: check with C&H folks what is planned about the Fitko demonstrator_

#### Revisit volume backup standard

sponsor: @mbuechse

- this was discussed in the Lean SCS Operator Call from 2025-06-12
- idea that @mbuechse overheard in a conversation:
  - cinder-backup can be a cheap-to-implement baseline that would even be useful if the "backup" happens in place, namely for doing snapshots
  - maybe consider and spell out use cases for backups and a backup hierarchy of sorts
- discussion:
  - a dedicated snapshot function does exist!
  - we might make this function mandatory
  - make backup recommended, however strong recommendation to put it on separate storage! (target S3 or NFS or similar)
  	- hard to detect this by an automated test
  	- ask provider to document this

#### Side-discussion: How to publish provider-provided information relevant to certification?

- ideally machine-readable and discoverable
	- `~/.well-known/self-description.yaml` (or `.json`)
	- Gaia-X VCs are overkill for this, unfortunately
	- Host in repo next to compliance monitor?
	- Alternative: SCS-defined discoverability service that is advertized in service catalogue (Keystone for OpenStack)
	- Think of airgapped scenarios
	- think of KaaS as well!
		- (Custom resources)
  - make this a dedicated topic for another day
    - for the time being, we can live with the situation that we only show the result for the backup testcase once it's been checked by an auditor
  - how about this: don't put the yaml/json into the repo, but an https URL to that file, so once people know the URL, they no longer need to send requests to Github (until the URL changes)

#### certification revocation if tests/checks fail

sponsor: @depressiveRobot

- [scs-0004-v1](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0004-v1-achieving-certification) says „automated tests MUST pass 99.x % of the runs, and the operator SHALL be notified at the second failed attempt in a row at the latest“
- in case of light tests the operator must be notified within max 2 days
- first feedback from Lean SCS Operator Coffee on 2025-06-26
  - scs-0004-v1 regulation 2 and 8 currently too restrictive
    - adapt based on YAML test configurations
  - make it clearer that responsibility for passing tests lies with the provider, not the certification body
  - notification of the operator should be automatic
  - avoiding false positive test failures to prevent getting used to it
- discussion:
  - regarding agreement to relax frequency of test runs (taken at the Hackathon in Stuttgart on 2026-06-03)
    - lower test frequency will result in less valuable statistics
    - resource consumption of testing negligible? (in context of energy/CO2)
  - `99.x %` should be fixed
  - notify automatically on first failing test (without review by a human), cf. issue [standards#899](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/899)
- _AI @depressiveRobot will brief @fkr_
