### Housekeeping

#### Designate people to transfer minutes and report in community call

- community call: @martinmo

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @mbuechse and @fdobrovolny: move [issues/#332](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/332) forward_
    - open
- _AI @mbuechse or @cah-hbaum: work with Team Container to bring [this](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/540) forward_
    - in progress: a stop-gap solution has been found and implemented
- _AI @jschoone: set up meeting with dNation experts_
    - done, we met on 2024-03-08 at 2; [summary of outcome courtesy of @matofeder](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/540#issuecomment-1987811042)

### Agenda

#### Node distribution standard extensions

sponsor: @mbuechse/@garloff, timebox: 8 min

- reference: issue [issues/494](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/494), PR [standards/524](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/524)
- in order to (a) improve transparency and (b) make testing possible, we now REQUIRE certain node labels:
    - `topology.kubernetes.io/region` as defined in the [k8s docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#topologykubernetesiozone)
    - `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` as defined in the [k8s docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#topologykubernetesioregion)
    - `topology.scs.community/host-id` (note: not necessarily the hostname, but some identifier _unique to the physical host_)
- Q: can we update v1?
    - strictly speaking, this change calls for a new major version of the standard
    - less strictly, more pragmatically:
        - v1 of the standard is really new and most likely _hasn't been adopted by anybody_
        - a new major version _clutters the space_
        - future people might wonder _unnecessarily_ what v1 was ever good for
    - shall we (a) update v1 or (b) create a v2?
- general endorsement for b
- alternative shortcut: make PR with status Stable
- _AI @mbuechse: write issue to add Implementation Notes Supplement_

#### New certificate scope versions for R6

sponsor: @mbuechse, timebox: 7 min

- `scs-compatible-iaas` **v4**: stable since 2024-02-28 ðŸŽ‰
    - see [docs](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-compatible-iaas), [source](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Tests/scs-compatible-iaas.yaml)
    - current openstack-flavor-manager versions can set extra_specs on existing flavors
    - the openstack-image-manager erroneously sets `image_source` to the mirror instead of the original source
        - Issue [osism/#913](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/913)
- `scs-compatible-kaas` **v1**: well, we have a working draft
    - see [docs](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-compatible-kaas), [source](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Tests/scs-compatible-kaas.yaml) (note: this also includes a v2 that is supposed to incorporate CNCF k8s conformance)
    - so far, k8s version policy will not test availability of all active k8s branches
    - also, the timeliness of patches for critical CVEs won't be tested for either; issue [standards/#536](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/526)
    - k8s node distribution should be tested for correctly, but the test requires certain labels; to be standardized, see issue [standards/#494](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/494)
    - we can provide the necessary scripts, for we include them as a pre-run job in our pipeline: PR [k8s-cluster-api-provider/#714](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/714) 
    - approach to have all nodes labeled in general: issue [issues/540](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/540)
    - try to get v1 stable by mid April if possible

#### CfP for OpenInfra Day, May 15

sponsor: @mbuechse, timebox: 10 min

- why not do a presentation of the current state as well as the lofty vision of standardization/certification
- it shouldn't be C&H people only though
- who wants to partake in a joint effort?
- _AI @mbuechse: set up meeting with @artificial-intelligence_

#### license for check scripts

sponsor: @artificial-intelligence, timebox: 10 min

- issue: [standards/533](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/533)
- there does not seem to be a dedicated source code licence for code inside the standards repository. I think this is a problem because the general licence for this repo is a CC licence and these are generally not a good fit for code (I am not a lawyer, so please correct me if this is a non-issue!)
- some scripts do indeed have an SPDX Header, but far from all: <https://github.com/search?q=repo%3ASovereignCloudStack%2Fstandards%20SPDX-License-Identifier&type=code>
- options:
    - either add a second licence text to the whole repository
    - or add individual SPDX Licence Identifiers to each test file
    - or both
- Proposal: add a linter that checks the presence of an SPDX Header in all code, a tool that can check for this is e.g. <https://github.com/github/go-spdx>
- Q: Your thoughts?
    - the CC license is arguably okay for scripting languages
    - the license is indeed specified at the repo's top level
    - we may still want to make the license explicit in each file
    - continue discussion in one of the next meetings

#### Standards / Decision Records split-off

sponsor: @markus-hentsch, timebox: 10 min

- PR: [standards#441](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/441)
- introduction section has been removed from DRs in the PR
    - @markus-hentsch: we have a "context" section already, I wouldn't know what to write as intro for a simple DR
    - Q: is the introduction necesssary?
    - A: yes, but introduction need not be more than one sentence (maybe call it abstract?)
- Q: create new md file for each decision (v1 = first decision, v2 = second decision, etc.) vs. maintain full DR history in a single md file?
    - with the current PR we would create a new DR document in the repo for each individual decision made over time
    - @markus-hentsch proposes to have the full history of all decisions in a continuously maintained DR
        - each decision would be a separate section in the document adhering to DR entry template like date, author, decision, reasoning etc.
        - see comment: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/441#issuecomment-1983988563>
    - A: new version only if the decision is actually changed
    - A: instead, next decision would get a new document id
    - A: certainly, decisions that are closely related (or even not independent of one another) can go into one document
