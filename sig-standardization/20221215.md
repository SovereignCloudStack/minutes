### Agenda

#### Place for conformance tests
* They are currently in gh/SCS/Docs/Design-Docs/tools/
* Keep them in Docs repo (close to the standards)?
* gh/SCS/Docs/Tests/ ? or Docs/Validation/ or Docs/Verification/ ?
-> Postpone until we have more clarity on testsuite framework

#### Extensible standards
* SCS flavor naming allows for an infinite number of SCS- flavors, as long as the names follow the rules
* Only a small finite number is mandatory (26 flavors currently)
* What do we recommend providers to do with additional flavors (beyond the 26 mandatory ones):
	- (1) Construct SCS names according to our rules?
		* Advantage: Name allows users to learn about properties (this however could also achieved by metadata that we want to standardize in the future)
		* Advantage: Two providers with the same extra flavor will very likely have the same name
		* Disadvantage: User can not conclude from the SCS- prefix that the flavor exists on all SCS clouds
	- (2) Use different (non-SCS) names:
		* Disadvantage: No standardization
		* Disdavantage: No conclusion to properties possible (until we have the metadata standardized)
		* Advantage: SCS- prefix means portability
	- (3) Add new prefix: `SCSx-4V:20:40` (note the `x` for eXtension)
		* Advantage: Can differentiate b/w mandatory and non-mandatory
		* Disadvantage: Once we add things to mandatory, names will change (providers can offer under two names, old SCSx- and new SCS- then to mitigate this)
Voting:
-> Variant 3 looks most attractive, Variant 2 least attractive
-> Variant 3 is a change vs. the current standard (two prefixes)
-> ADR to discuss and document decision (@garloff)

This is a generic topic: We may have a systematic way to standardize things and only a subset is mandatory.
