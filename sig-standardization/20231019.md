### Housekeeping

#### Designate people to transfer minutes and report in community call

- @fdobrovolny

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @garloff: ensure that @maxwolfs has the latest revision from @alexander-diab for [PR docs/#76](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/76)_
    - DONE
- _AI @maxwolfs and others: adjust docs page (subject->scope), input from @garloff/@alexander-diab_
    - PR#76, done
- _AI @mbuechse: adjust scs-0003 (type->scope)_
    - DONE, see [standards/#347](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/347)
- _AI: @fkr will organize a preparation meeting to prioritize issues in [epic standards/#285](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/285)_
    - open
 
### Agenda

#### Test framework/organization and intervals

- how often to run in general?
    - @josephineSei [suggested](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/356#discussion_r1350240316) as follows: "such tests need to be done whenever a deployment is updated (e.g. config change, security fix, etc..)."
    - partition tests according to cost (runtime etc.)?
        - idea: run cheap tests more often than expensive tests
        - more costly tests (which create resources) could be done less often
            - Putting them into different buckets (such as light, medium, heavy) will need to be reflected in the standard
            - _AI @mbuechse: extend scs-0003_
        - manual tests may only happen once per quarter
- make tests more efficient by using a framework of sorts? 
    - idea: get rid of unnecessary roundtrips to OpenStack
        - Not an issue for the current tests (but of course could become one in the future)
        - Keeping tests separated is valuable
    - maybe also have a uniform environment (security groups, network topology, ssh access)
        - That may be the reason to justify a more complex framework (cleaning up in case of errors)
    - desire: make test scripts more uniform
        - python unittests framework seems attractive
        - helps with results collection as well
    - access to providers
        - currently in <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/.github/scs-compliance-check/openstack/clouds.yaml> plus github secrets
        - in the process of being migrated to Zuul, see [standard/#316](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/316)
        - May need to be extended for domain manager tests (second cloud entry per cloud?)
- do we want to organize tests in frameworks?
    - maybe easier to add/edit test
    - easier for deployers? -> only one file to describe resource like user, projects, etc... needed for the test execution
    - [standards/#359](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/359)
        - Please review so we are in a position to decide
        - PoC wanted: How would this be implemented?

#### Progress regarding documentation

- presentation by @maxwolfs
- draft available in [PR 76](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/76)
    - have a look at the [preview deployment](https://docs-staging.scs.community/standards)
    - text still to be revised within #76
- documentation for Domain Manager standard added in [PR 93](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/93)
- the new structure and visualization finds the unanimous approval of the group
- next steps:
    - ask for reviews
    - get it merged after a round of improvements
    - further improvements are always possible in followup PRs

#### Processes for initial certification and continued compliance tracking

- please [review PR standards/#356](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/356)!
- currently open questions
    - how often to test (covered by item above about test framework)
