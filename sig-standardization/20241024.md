### Agenda

:rotating_light: NOTE: topics that don't mention the sponsor/author/presenter will not be discussed. If no timebox is mentioned, the timebox will be 10 minutes (which can be overruled by the group).

#### Network policies (KaaS v1)
- ToDo:
    - Reference precise upstream Network Policy spec (with `AdminNetworkPolicy` if possible) and write draft standard (AI @kgube via @anjastrunk)
    - Testcase (@kgube)
    - Ensure reference implementation passes (@jschoone)
- Maybe the metadata service access protection will not make it into v1 ... then we should at least have a draft

#### IaaS v5 and KaaS v1 planning

* IaaS v5 has a draft, but still lacks the new standards (AI: @mbuechse via @anjastrunk)
* EPIC: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/718
    * 4 new standards
    * Add security standard from Josephine
        * May not be testable for now
        * BSI C5 input is helpful (recommended response times)
    * Volume backend: https://docs-staging.scs.community/standards/iaas/scs-0117/
    * AZ std: https://docs-staging.scs.community/standards/iaas/scs-0121/
    * Demonstrator:  https://compliance.sovereignit.cloud/page/detail/poc-wgcloud/50393e6f-2ae1-4c5c-a62c-3b75f2abef3f

* KaaS v1: EPIC https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/615
    * Question: Are these standards implementable on other implementations than our reference implementation?
        * Designed to support it
        * To validate, a second implementation would be desirable, e.g. PSKE/Gardener/yake, would need validation
            * Somebody from the "Alle machen Gardener" faction should be doing it ...
                * @fkr will ask B1 Systems
            * @anjastrunk will check with C&H dNation consultants
