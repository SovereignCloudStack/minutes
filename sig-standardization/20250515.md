### Housekeeping

- upcoming week @fkr will not be here

#### Designate people for chores

- minute taking: @mbuechse
- minutes transfer: @mbuechse

#### Check AIs from last time

- technically none, but @mbuechse has updated all issues that were touched in the last session

### Agenda

#### Simplify/straighten test code

sponsor: @mbuechse

- having an ever increasing amount of unused code in the codebase makes refactoring more and more painful over time
- proposal: PLEASE allow deleting really old stuff (since we have records of everything in git)
  - timeline entries that are no longer current (maybe when at least 6 months old?)
  - versions no longer referenced in the timeline (prior to v3)
  - modules no longer referenced by any version (e.g., old flavor naming)
  - code paths (cmd line switches) no longer referenced by any module (ditto)
- decision:
  - go ahead
  - mention git in yaml file (comment)
  - mention "history in git" in scs-0003-v1

#### Lookout on ECO:DIGIT standardization 

sponsor: @fkr

- I want to give an outlook on what is going to be addressed in the next 12 months from the ECO:DIGIT project in relation to standardization of assessment and reporting of environmental effects
- new colleague in ECO:DIGIT project, meet him in community meeting tomorrow
- one major topic (among others):
  - how should energy use (and emissions) be reported

#### Certification of CSPs and SPs by the Forum

sponsor: @fkr

- The Forum will start with the certification of CSPs and SPs. As such I want to give an lookout what is happening there. 

#### Relax entropy standard

sponsor: @mbuechse

- should `rngd` really be required? 
  - `rngd` is necessary for using an external or virtualized rng
  - it's most likely not enabled in stock OS images
    - it can be installed using cloud-config user-data
    - but then it could already be too late, if random numbers are needed for SSL
  - those few people who NEED an external rng probably bring their own image anyway
  - cf. this [comment in standards#674](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/674#issuecomment-2291415278)
- proposal:
  - relax standard, drop requirement (no new major version necessary)
- are rng-related image/flavor properties really required?
  - scs-0102-v1 states `hw_rng_model` is required, but the test treats it as recommended (see agenda item above)
  - scs-0101-v1 states `hw_rng_model` as recommended
  - according to [OpenStack docs](https://docs.openstack.org/glance/2024.1/admin/useful-image-properties.html), the property will be ignored unless the flavor has `hw_rng:allowed` set to True (which scs-0101-v1 also recommends)
- proposal:
  - drop all requirements and recommendations regarding the image property and the flavor property
  - or at least be consistent and use recommendations throughout
- decision:
  - write to scs-tech list announcing the intention to drop everything with some deadline for objections
  - maybe mention cpu modelling in hypervisor settings
  - _AI @mbuechse: ask @horazont about pointers_

#### revisit image names and flavor names

sponsor: came up spontaneously/@gtema

- relaxing standard images standard
  - we decided last time that we wanted to prove viability of name-independent image selection by means of the cluster-stacks implementation
  - however, this implementation brings its own very specific (capi) image? is it related to standard images standard at all?
  - or does it use standard images as well (maybe as base for building the capi image)
- shortcoming of this standard
  - instruction set architecture is an attribute of the image
  - standard images standard doesn't mention architecture
  - so what do you get when you select "Ubuntu 24.04"??
- draft proposal:
  - relax name requirement by using regex
  - if multiple images match the regex...
    - is that permissible? how do people then select the right one?
    - if it's not permissible, could this even be practical?
    - if it's permissible, shall these images then all have the same ISA? could this even be practical?
    - so this whole venture seems a bit problematic
    - put back on agenda
