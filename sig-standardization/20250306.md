### Participants (github handles preferred)

### Housekeeping

- No meeting next week (2025-03-13) due to unavailability of key people

#### Designate people for chores

- minute taking: @mbuechse
- minutes transfer: @mbuechse
- community call: n/a

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @mbuechse: move to code repo scs-health-monitor_ (wrt [standards#576](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/576))
  - still open
- _AI @garloff: add note "maintenance mode" to the "old" openstack-health-monitor_
  - This is actually done since 2024-11-11 ([PR#200](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/openstack-health-monitor/pull/200), see [commit](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/openstack-health-monitor/pull/200/commits/1e877f342c0a90a8604da4b3c3470db970d3cdf2))
  - Please let me (@garloff) know if you see the need to improve the wording

### Agenda

#### State of the compliance

sponsor: @mbuechse

- test subject gx-scs (scs1) is no more
  - will replace it by scs2 ([PR standards/#885](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/885))
- SCS-compatible IaaS v4 is still in "warn" state
  - multiple subjects still not ready for v5.1
  - volume backup timeout
    - find out manually how long this would take
    - share credentials in project team
  - volume backup fails because resource in bad state, can only be deleted by admin (upstream cinder issue!)
  - biggest issue: the test regarding S3 (see next agenda item)
    - @garloff verified that S3 works in general on the platforms in question
    - will debug script --> assign bug ticket once it exists
  - general:
    - make sure script reports are consistent (result vs. return code vs. log output)
- _AI @mbuechse: create issues for above-mentioned tasks_

#### Usability issue compliance monitor

- Tests that don't finish don't have a link to a log file, which is bad.
- --> Issue [standards/#889](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/889)

#### Check for mandatory IaaS services

sponsor: @mbuechse

- [check script](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Tests/iaas/mandatory-services/mandatory-iaas-services.py) has multiple minor issues, see [standards#862](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/862)

#### Notification mechanism

- contact address for each test subject needed
- send mail to some appointee from Forum SCS-Standards as well as contact of test subject
- _AI @mbuechse: create issue_

#### OpenShift vs. SCS KaaS

sponsor: @fkr (5-10 minutes)

- @fkr had a very informative meeting with a colleague on this
- for details, see also [this HedgeDoc](https://input.scs.community/RRrL0sOUQ-aKq-04XKjZ6w)
- @mato-feder is working on an OpenShift (or rather, OKD) setup so that we can test; will create issues for whatever standards refinements we deem necessary

#### Open pull requests

sponsor: @mbuechse

- PR [standards#831](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/831)
  - titled "Feat/add cluster stacks remote api plugin"
  - will be taken up again with issue [standards#882](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/882)
  - goal: make this usable for both moin-cluster (which seems to have been migrated to SCS2) and Syself's offering
- PR [standards#570](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/570)
  - DNS standard (we discussed it last time)
  - @markus-hentsch told me that this should be vetted by an expert with practical experience, especially the question whether it has been diluted too much under the CSP influence
  - Decision: Merge as draft. (Fix CI issues if needed.)
  - To Do (future): Create tests, see where providers are and communicate issues before stabilizing.
- PR [standards#577](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/577)
  - NTP *decision record* (we discussed it last time)
  - @kgube told me that this is a record of our decision on how to proceed, and thus it's mainly a list of four to-dos
    1. standardize a portable NTP setup as an interface to timesync (probably via DHCP)
    2. standardize quality criteria regading the provided time
    3. work upstream to create a feature that permits providing a local NTP service on a link-local address in some subnet (this could be a prerequisite for no. 1 or an add-on, that depends)
    4. come up with recommendations for CSPs on how to handle their internal time sync in general (independent of the other three points)
  - we could merge it in draft state and also convert the points 1.--4. into issues
