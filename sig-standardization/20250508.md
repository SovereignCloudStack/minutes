### Housekeeping

#### Designate people for chores

- minute taking: @mbuechse
- minutes transfer: @mbuechse
- community call: n/a

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @mbuechse: create issues for improving volume-backup script, Swift/S3 script, general script quality_
  - DONE: [standards#902](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/902), @mbuechse used this PR to improve volume-backup script; other scripts had been improved already
- _AI @mbuechse: create issue regarding notification mechanism for compliance monitor_
  - DONE: [standards#899](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/899)

### Agenda

#### Compliance monitor: table vs. table_full

sponsor: @mbuechse

- @garloff opened [standard#904](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/904)
- where to document the difference? it should be discreet
  - document it publicly, but mostly findable for people who're explicitly looking for it
  - also have as much available as possible without login
- who may see the log files? we may make sure not to disclose credentials, but they will most certainly contain implementation details of the CSP that should be regarded as internal
  - what is the use case (besides SCS-open maybe)
  - how easy should it be for people to learn about the implementation (normally, they would have to pay for creating a VM)
  - we could publish those log lines that are explicitly linked to the outcomes of testcases (i.e., curated logs)
- **decision:**
  - make both table/table_full w/curated logs public with sufficient warning about table_full being tentative
  - make detailed logs available with login

#### Notification mechanism for compliance monitor

sponsor: @mbuechse

- issue [standards#899](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/899)
- where to store the contact info for each test subject?
  - probably not in plain text in the repo, to avoid attracting spam?
  - we could use Zuul secrets or maybe just a simple encoding such as base32?
- we may want to be able to store a contact that's not open to the general public
- **decision:**
  - use secret (Zuul or vault)

#### image metadata check too lenient?

sponsor: @mbuechse

- see issue [standards#913](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/913)
- proposal:
  - be more strict in test when min_ram or min_disk is 0
    - decision: reject 0
    - could even demand that VM must be able to boot with the values given
  - be less strict in std when hypervisor_type or hw_rng_model is not set
    - some img might work with multiple hypervisors

#### Simplify adoption of SCS standards

sponsor: @mbuechse

- problem: adding flavors or images just for compliance can confuse customers
  - e.g., "Why do they now have two images for Ubuntu 24.04" (well, the standard images standard requires a certain name, and they didn't want to delete the old image for compatibility reasons)
  - or ephemeral storage is present for every flavor for some reason (customer expectation, issues adding boot volume to custom UI, fear of flavor proliferation)
  - OTOH, changing a variable in your IaC script shouldn't be too big a barrier for migrating between clouds? (you have to change the endpoints anyway, and that is true for multicloud as well)
- discussion:
  - prove by means of our cluster-stacks implementation that it's possible to work with fewer fixed image/flavor names
  - then derive best practices and document them for the users
  - then we can drop the requirement for standardized names
