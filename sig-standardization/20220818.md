### Agenda today
CaaS
* Slides: https://scs.sovereignit.de/nextcloud/apps/files/?dir=/Sovereign%20Cloud%20Stack/Technology/ContainerStandardization-2022&openfile=103596
* OpenAPI/Swagger to document REST API
* Synchronous calls for POST, PUT, DELETE? (Can take several minutes ...)
  * Error handling when doing asynchronous things?
  * Async: User needs to poll
* Read RFC4122: UUID vs Names?
* Avoid need for own persistent data, only rely on backend CAPI/SCS operator
* Discoverability: Respond with Open-API schema on a well-known endpoint
  * open-API is great for generating automated code (library) to talk to the API
  * not so ideal for discovering what specifically is supported by a provider?
  => use open API for cluster REST interface
  => Allowed values defined by SCS (do namespace management to e.g. require domain name prefixes for extensions by providers)
  * X-Auth: TOKEN should typpically work and allow to generate auth 
* Allowing to link IAM from IaaS platform (keycloak) to Container offers nice possibilities
