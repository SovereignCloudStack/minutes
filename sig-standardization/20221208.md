### Agenda

#### Process and Roles
* Alex proposal status
	- Continuous monitoring of compliance
		* After some time not fixing issues, certificate will be voided
		* After some time, old versions may be deprecated and no longer serve as certifiable standards

#### Certification metadata
* Stabilized standards may become part of certification requirements (and thus mandatory) by being referenced in certification metadata doc (see PR #148)

Proposals
* Use 22.04 (date-based release) version format rather than v3, v4, ..
	
Open questions:
* How  to indicate backward-compatible vs. incompatible changes?
(Definition of backwards-compatible: Apps developed against vOLD work against infra compatible with vNEW)

#### ADRs to be written
* See issues #166, #167, #211, #213, #219, #226, #227, #229, #230, #231
  -> @fkr to take the relevant ones for ops-iam and iaas into the team calls
* Convert flavor spec (#207) and image metadata (#208) specs into standards format
