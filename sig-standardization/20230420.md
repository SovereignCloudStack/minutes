### Agenda


#### General topics

* Anja asks, how the different defined standards, where C&H works on creating a compliance check, they would leave comments and track accomplishments
* C&H is invited to critically comment on the practicality of defined standards

#### Going through the standards ...

* Convert table from slides (AI @mbuechse)
* Flavor naming: v2 under discussion ...
    * https://input.scs.community/Why-Standardized-Flavors-And-Names#
* Josephine suggests a standard for a differentiation on volume types at IaaS layer, especially on naming not only with respect to encryption, but also on performance classes (AI: @JosephineSei)
* Split systematic flavor naming from mandatory standard flavors: AI @mbuechse
* Flavor discoverability: Try to work w/ upstream Public Cloud WG ()
* Entropy: Needs test, including scenario tests, trouble is to ensure resources are cleaned up under all circumstances (including temporarily unavailable API etc.) (AI: @cah-baum)
* For testing this kind of standards and others, a VM needs to be spawned on the target environment. This requires a new kind of compliance check solution  (beyond the existing check script. 
* If cloud resources have to be created under test, we should reuse existing python code from e.g. tempest or build our own framework
