### Agenda

#### Domain-manager requirement potentially problematic

sponsor: @fkr

- continuation of last week's discussion
- side note: direct access to the OpenStack API seems to become increasingly irrelevant due to additional APIs
    - however, this would affect our IaaS certification as a whole
    - even if the end customer doesn't see the OpenStack, having the certificate can be beneficial for internal reasons (multi-cloud environments where KaaS is deployed on multiple, but compatible IaaS offerings)
- side note 2: increasingly, identities don't originate in Keystone, but in Keycloak somewhere (so the customer may not be able to use the domain-manager feature)
    - can we still do some reasonable standardization in this scenario?
- main discussion
    - historically, domains were not present as a concept
    - we don't want to certify "archeological" installations
    - apparently, we don't mandate that customers have the right to USE the role (which would be the case with the default domain)?
        - what then is the point of this standard?
        - it seems we need to make the standard stronger, but this may leave room for accommodating CSPs that don't want to use domains(?)
        - one option is to make this part optional and to show it explicitly in the details page (as with other recommended parts of our certification)
- _AI @fkr: include CSPs and public-cloud sig into discussion_

#### Current state regarding manual checks/audits

sponsor: @mbuechse

- tentative language regarding this topic does exist, albeit in the [PR standards#781](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/781)
- merge pertinent PR by Feb 6 as draft, so that the Forum SCS-Standards can discuss
- _AI @mbuechse: invite people via list scs-tech_
- additional work may be necessary because some standards do lack testing notes
- also, procedures may need to be defined on the end of the Forum SCS-Standards regarding how to proceed with the auditing

#### Open pull requests

sponsor: @mbuechse

- we're doing it live: [list of open PRs, most recently updated first](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
- talk about open issues next time
- modus operandi (starting in February):
    - for each SIG meeting, every volunteer takes on one PR and prepares an overview to guide a discussion in the meeting regarding what is to be done (potentially, but hopefully rarely, closing the PR)
    - do assign yourself to the PR to indicate that you have taken it in order to avoid double work
