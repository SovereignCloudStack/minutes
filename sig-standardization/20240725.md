### Housekeeping

#### Designate people to transfer minutes and report in community call

- @mbuechse

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @mbuechse and @fdobrovolny: move [issues/#332](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/332) forward_
    - open
- _AI @mbuechse: check whether we need to use an overflow slot_
    - open
- _AI @fkr: query CSPs to check our hypotheses above, in order to prepare a break-out session_
    - open
- _AI @mbuechse: try to arrange for a break-out session regarding more fine-granular or structured badges/certifications_
    - not done, but I prepared a concrete proposal (see agenda)

### Agenda

#### Update clouds table to SCS-compatible IaaS v4

sponsor: @mbuechse, 7 mins

- [Ceterum censeo...](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceterum_censeo_Carthaginem_esse_delendam)
- see PR [standards/#600](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/600)
- recap from last meeting: why are the badges red?
    - CSPs not interested?
    - lacking resources? (what are we do to about that?)
    - lacking urgency?
    - insufficient instructions?
- send e-mail to list announcing that the merge will happen tomorrow (Friday); _AI @garloff_
- we might show multiple badges (best compliant version, compliance of current version)
    - only consider as emergency fallback position

#### SCS-compatible IaaS v5, end of Aug!

sponsor: @mbuechse, 8 mins

- rather certain
    - v2 of standard flavors std, see [standards/#594](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/594), please [do review](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/630)!
- rather uncertain
    - include [Volume Type Standard](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0114-v1-volume-type-standard)? (not stable yet)
    - include [Default Rules for Security Groups](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0115-v1-default-rules-for-security-groups)? (not stable yet, no test yet)
    - include [IAM topics](https://docs.scs.community/standards/iam/)? (two standards that aren't stable yet, one of them very rudimentary, one of them probably requiring manual/privileged tests)
- unlikely (not even in main)
    - [VM clock synchronisation](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/577)
    - [provider networks](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/572)
    - [DNS](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/570)
    - [volume backup](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/567)
    - [Secure Connections](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/548)
    - [Availability Zone Standard](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/640)
    - [Key Manager](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/599)
    - [mandatory and supported IaaS services](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/587)
    - ...
- timeline
    - _deadline for inclusion into v5_: **2024-08-15**
    - NOTE: a standard must have working tests and be stable in order to be included!
    - will _finalize v5_ in meeting of **2024-08-22**
    - note: R7 (vs. R6) most likely does not bring any features that are relevant wrt our (current) standards
- desirable:
    - volume type std, default rules for SGs

#### Proposal of certification yaml revamp

sponsor: @mbuechse, 12 mins

- see issue [standards/#660](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/660) and accompanying PR
    - only a preview; scs-0003-v1 not adapted yet
- with this proposal, badges can be made more fine-grained
    - each script can now handle multiple "test items"
    - certification can have multiple "targets" (one of them being "main")
    - each target refers to a collection of test items that have to be passed
    - target "main" determines the overall badge
    - targets can overlap
- it has some other benefits, too:
    - more explicit sharing of commonalities between versions (no longer copy the whole standard from one version to the next)
    - more explicit timeline wrt validity of versions (handle interdependencies better: version X goes to "warn" while version Y becomes "effective"; this would also solve Issue [standards/#591](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/591) arguably better than current PR [standards/#605](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/605))
- as an aside, please keep in mind:
    - the overall badge cannot be determined by the main check script
    - multiple runs may have to be aggregated
    - that is what the [compliance monitor](https://compliance.sovereignit.cloud/pages) does
- opinions
    - need good docs for script writers
    - debugging by reenactment on local machine as far as possible (even for operators who aren't using the compliance monitor YET) -- run everything that can be done automatically and output a result "with reservations" (regarding potentially missing audits), also needs a good description for CSPs / their users (blog article?)
    - rename key "checks" to "items" or "requirements"? take discussion offline

#### Handling certificate variants and exemptions

sponsor: @mbuechse, 8 mins

- example: a cloud environment that is private/air-gapped may not need to (or be able to) offer public IP addresses, so the corresponding requirements do not apply
- this case can't be handled without a separate certificate scope, neither with the status quo nor with the proposal from the previous agenda item
- questions:
    - do we make a dedicated scope? / do we want to parametrize the existing scope somehow?
    - do we require some .well-known self description?
- opinions
    - keep it simple
    - we could in fact make "public IP" stuff an additional target, which does not determine the badge as a whole

#### Minor topics

sponsor: @mbuechse, 5 mins

- simplify [standards overview table](https://docs.scs.community/standards/standards/overview)
    - column "Stable" represents an edge case that almost never happens
    - therefore, it's empty almost all the time
    - proposal: merge it with "Effective", marking future-stable versions with some symbol (such as dagger or asterisk)
    - additionally, mark future-deprecated with another symbol
    - issue [docs/#215](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/issues/215)
- use a standardized name scheme for Tests directory:
    - sometimes, scripts are not easy to find
    - the directory containing the scripts for standard `scs-NNNN` should be named `scs-NNNN-...`
    - issue [standards/#667](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/667)
