### Housekeeping

#### Check pending Action Items

- _AI @garloff create PR for openstack-image-manager to add field `os_purpose`_
  - DONE: [OSISM/openstack-image-manager#952](https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/pull/952)
- _AI @mbuechse: create a check list (regarding scs-0125) and then ask the vendors (OSISM, ALASCA) whether this is currently feasible_
  - open
- _AI @mbuechse: survey CSPs_ regarding the addition of Flatcar to standard images (as recommendation)
  - won't do; avoid favoring one OS

### Agenda

#### Testing OpenInfra Interop

sponsor: @mbuechse

- @fungi pointed out on Matrix that refstack-client is going to be retired very soon: see [this mailing-list post from July 30, 2025](https://lists.openstack.org/archives/list/openstack-discuss@lists.openstack.org/thread/WNI4PE2TZ3G52C3U5FT2YNVRUAJB3CMO/#GT36C4CTMVTZCRVDABAZSZOX6KD2URBZ)
- @fzakfeld reported on Matrix that getting refstack-client to work is troublesome
- let's try to sort it out together
  - refstack-client needs a list, and this is supposed to be downloaded from refstack.openstack.cloud, but that server has already been taken offline
  - we need to find a way to supply the necessary list (could be a static file on GitHub) or extract it automatically using `jq` or so
- @garloff is on the case:
  - For `os_powered_compute` mandatory tests:
    `curl https://opendev.org/openinfra/interop/raw/branch/master/guidelines/2022.11.json | jq '.components.os_powered_compute.capabilities.required.[]' | tr -d '"'`

#### Draft of next SCS-compatible IaaS

sponsor: @mbuechse

- see PR [standards#985](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/985)
- I merely wanted to showcase the finegrained testcases
  - functionally equivalent with v5.1
- current high visibility of v6 could harm reputation of v5.1
  - in this case: integrate into v5.1, because it's functionally equivalent
  - in general: don't use number for next version, but a fixed codename, like Debian sid; maybe just call it 'draft'
  - we could also exclude draft versions from the list of verified results (so show on /page/table_full, but not on /page/table, ditto for /page/detail_full vs. /page/detail)
  - and we could use a separate column for draft versions
- decision:
  - rename to 'next' or similar
  - only show on table_full
  - _AI @mbuechse: implement this_

#### Larger memory flavors

sponsor: @mbuechse

- see PR [standards#938](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/938)
- I think we had reached a decision, but nothing seems to have happened
- decision was to add bigger flavors as recommendation
- @berendt has added a feature to openstack-flavor-manager to filter recommended flavors by max memory size
- make a note that these recommendations are intended to avoid flavor proliferation between providers
- _AI @mbuechse: finalize PR_

#### Adjust k8s networking tests to account for KPR Cilium

sponsor: @mbuechse

- (KPR means kube-proxy replacement)
- for details, see issue [standards#982](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/982), courtesy of Syself
- apparently, the networking tests in Sonobuoy do test a few edge cases that could be considered implementation details, and those fail with KPR Cilium
- value of these testases for the customer is debatable
- Team Container [last Friday](https://input.scs.community/2025-scs-team-container#SCS-KaaS-Standards-vs-Conformance-Tests) already agreed that tests should be relaxed
  - will provide list of testcases to be excluded
  - standard need not be changed, but implementation and testing notes should be refined
- discussion:
  - maybe SCTP should still be required, given that it could simply be enabled in Cilium
- @mbuechse added comment to above-mentioned PR

#### Delivering documentation for manual audit

sponsor: @mbuechse

- just an idea I had to simplify the process for manual audit
  - recall that the compliance monitor receives its information about failed and passed testcases by way of cryptographically signed report.yaml files
  - in principle, it would be possible to manually write a report.yaml file that states: testcases XYZ have been passed, where XYZ could be manual testcases, say `availability-zones-check`
  - as usual, the CSP would have to sign this
  - if they upload such a file to the compliance monitor, the testcases will be marked PASS, no questions asked
  - we would interpret this as "I, the CSP, hereby sign that, to the best of my knowledge, the test subject (my cloud) satisfies the testcases XYZ, and I am willing to supply proof to the certification assessment body (the Forum) on short notice"
- of course, we could supply automation for that (trivial, once the signing keys are clear)
- advantages: simplification and decoupling/desyncing
  - the corresponding items on the form could be simplified to "I have submitted passing results to the compliance monitor for the following testcases (... checklist ...), and corresponding documentation is attached or will be supplied within 3 months"
  - the compliance monitor can be filled in by the CSP with immediate effect (how rewarding!) and independently of the whole form business, even if the CSP doesn't apply for certification (yet), or if the desired version of the scope is still in draft state
  - the benefits will be especially evident when the certificate is to be renewed for a new version of the scope, because then the signing keys and the automation will be readily in place
- discussion:
  - don't make it too tempting to just make a testcase pass by a simple click
  - maybe use tri-state: fail, tentative pass, pass
  - at any rate, the form is not meant to be a final process
  - so, let's table this discussion for the time being
