### Agenda

### Getting CSPs back to green (@garloff, 5mins)

- @mbuechse reached out to PS, got illuminating response
    - tooling could be more accessible (see [this issue](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/issues/212))
    - new features (such as extra_specs or new flavors) have low priority
- _AI @garloff to run after CSPs to get them back to green ..._

#### Presentation at EOF event

sponsor: @mbuechse

- our SIG has a slot at the [EOF event](https://events.scs.community/eof/) (20 mins) on 2024-09-05
- I (@mbuechse) won't be able to attend myself, but I can coordinate our contribution
- objective: celebrate what's been achieved, share knowledge
- let's not present so much what's missing (but discuss here)
    - KaaS is one big hole :(
- let's present what we have achieved
    - impressive table of partner clouds (make them green by then)
    - appealing and instructive documentation (thanks to Max!)
    - working test suite (okay, improve error messages by then...)
    - processes regarding certification
    - compliance monitor (finish details page by then)
- talk about vision?
    - interoperability, reliability, sovereignty!
- Q: who can present?
    - @anjastrunk
    - PLUS someone else
    - _AI @mbuechse: ask @artificial-intelligence_
- @mbuechse can support, e.g., by providing a first draft

#### Lifetime periods of testcase results

sponsor: @mbuechse

- see [this comment](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/668#discussion_r1714264167)
- no urgency, not a real issue

#### Future of Interop Guidelines

sponsor: @mbuechse

- triggered by [this comment](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/300#issuecomment-2278535129)
- continuation of discussion in yesterday's Team IaaS meeting
- general battle of approaches (resolve this first?)
    - two approaches
        1. guaranteed service interfaces (contracts to be tested and fulfilled)
        2. common tools (opentofu, ansible) work as expected (in whatever way)
    - use 1. for those APIs that are mostly static and basic
    - use 2. for those APIs that are more complicated, where one goal could be achieved with different means, not all of them necessarily present
- refstack/tempest tests are rather shallow
    - maybe necessary, but not sufficient
- candidates for replacement:
    - maybe [issues/#528](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/528)
        - should we include real API tests then instead of just a [simple query](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/bbbf13f5d654000ba5fe9339b19d728ce20e2117/Tests/iaas/mandatory-services/mandatory-iaas-services.py#L37) which services are present?
    - consider reusing tempest/refstack for actual API tests
- decision:
    - keep it in
    - in the future, we need to make sure that these guidelines get updated

#### Migrate official compliance tests to Zuul

sponsor: @mbuechse

- issue: [standards/#672](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/672)
- Zuul needs to be stable; @gtema: yes, it is
- for the sake of completeness: [new Zuul instance](https://zuul.sovereignit.cloud/t/scs/builds)
- how important are the notification e-mails?
    - most people prefer looking at the dashboard
    - so, it's okay to postpone this feature
