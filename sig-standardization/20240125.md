### Agenda

#### 'Implementation and Testing notes' supplementary documents

sponsor: @mbuechse

- still open for review: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/437>

#### New certificate scope versions for February

sponsor: @mbuechse

- editorial deadline: next meeting, Feb 8
- whatever is finished by then, we can include and have a vote on
- NB: we can only include stable standards
- _AI @mbuechse: push for stabilization of candidate standards_
- _AI @mbuechse: announce the intended new scope widely so that CSPs have an opportunity to assess it, to prepare, and to intervene if necessary_

#### Keep logs/history of compliance checks from zuul (@mbuechse)

- [standards/#381](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/381)
- Badges in zuul: https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/howtos/badges.html
- Need to store historic information (logs, results)
    - Keeping zuul results on zuul server easily possible?
    - Or push results to web server (scp/sftp/...)

#### Differentiation between DR and Standards moving forward

sponsor: @cah-hbaum

- still open for review [standards/#441](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/441)
- apart from the differentiation, the second main thrust is to harmonize the structure across all the standards and to make it binding to a higher degree (currently, scs-0001-v1 does not mandate any sections, for instance)
- to this end: work out what this harmonized structure could look like, not only in the abstract, but with select concrete standards (say, three of the more prominent ones)

#### where do we place Tang/Clevis

(dropped because no sponsor was present; feel free to revive it in a future agenda)
