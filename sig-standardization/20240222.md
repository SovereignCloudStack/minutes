### Housekeeping

#### Designate people to transfer minutes and report in community call
- @fdobrovolny

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @mbuechse: announce the intended new scope widely so that CSPs have an opportunity to assess it, to prepare, and to intervene if necessary_
    - sent a mail to scs-tech list
- _AI @mbuechse and @fdobrovolny: move [issues/#332](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/332) forward_
    - work is progressing fine (todo: create community pages on this)

### Agenda

:rotating_light: NOTE: topics that don't mention the sponsor/author/presenter will not be discussed.

#### New certificate scope versions for February

sponsor: @mbuechse

- KaaS v1 not ready due to missing tests
    - Two stabilized standards: scs-0210-v2, scs-0214-v1
        - scs-0210-v1 had tests, they need updating for v2
        - scs-0214: not so obvious how to test
    - Vote now: stabilize by 2024-02-29 provided tests get implemented
        - yes: 4, no: 0, abstain: 2
- IaaS v4:
    - scs-0103-v1 Standard Images still not stable: PR [standards/#464](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/464) should have been voted upon yesterday, but @mbuechse was indisposed Monday and yesterday, and he forgot it on Tuesday :/
    - scs-0101-v3 Flavor Naming does not allow v1 names, but we still tolerated them anyways -- this is inconsistent, need better reasoning, more transparency
    - vote to stabilize v4 without scs-0103-v1 (or find a way to quickly stabilize the latter)
        - mail to list about the stabilization intent
        - vote now: we stabilize v4 with date 2024-02-28 once the stabilization of scs-0103-v1 goes through
            - yes: 5, no: 0, abstain: 1

#### Keep logs/history of compliance checks from zuul

sponsor: @mbuechse

- issue [standards/#381](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/381)
- recall [scs-0004-v1](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0004-v1-achieving-certification)
    - results published for at most 18 months
    - outliers (one-time failures) do not lead to immediate revocation of the certificate (probably yellow or grey badge)
    - test results (yaml report) need not come from our Zuul, but they may be handed in by the CSPs (especially for non-public clouds)
- we could distinguish following cases
    - test was passed: green badge
    - test went through, but wasn't passed---ONCE: yellow badge
    - test failed---ONCE: grey badge
    - test wasn't passed or it failed---more than once: red badge
- be careful with false positives (i.e., red badge even though the cloud is fine, but our test has a defect)
    - providers may not be amused (because people put blame on them), and we may be understaffed to deal with the defect at once
    - idea 1: use pull request to record the red badge, so manual approval is necessary before it goes public
        - pros: would use established infrastructure; clean, transparent procedure
        - cons: introduces delays, requires people to be appointed for this task, increases load on these people
    - idea 2: have a larger window of tolerance (e.g., badge grey for multiple days before turning red)
        - pros: buys us time to investigate; works without manual intervention
        - cons: could be a bit more tricky to set the procedure up properly
    - people in the meeting seem a bit split as to which idea is better, but ultimately, idea 2 seems to win out
    - whenever something fails, immediately notify both provider (or provider fetches monitoring endpoint) and scs team
