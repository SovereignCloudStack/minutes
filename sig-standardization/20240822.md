### Housekeeping

#### Designate people for chores

- minute taking: @mbuechse
- minutes transfer: @mbuechse
- community call: @mbuechse

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @mbuechse and @fdobrovolny: move [issues/#332](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/332) forward_
    - open
- _AI @fkr: query CSPs to check our hypotheses above, in order to prepare a break-out session_
    - obsolete in the meantime thanks to Kurt's initiative
- _AI @bitkeks: work on standard regarding pentesting_
    - open
- _AI @garloff to run after CSPs to get them back to green ..._
    - done, [new blogpost](https://scs.community/tech/2024/08/20/flavor-extra-specs-compliance/) and [new admin tool](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Tests/iaas/flavor-naming/flavor-add-extra-specs.py)
    - Kurt wants to put table of partner clouds' standards compliance on landing page as well
- _AI @mbuechse: ask @artificial-intelligence whether he can join in on our presentation at EOF_
    - done: he can join, but he can't prepare a lot

### Agenda

#### Finalizing SCS-compatible IaaS v5

sponsor: @mbuechse

- original deadline: TODAY EOB
- follow-up to [same topic from 2024-07-25](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/minutes/blob/main/sig-standardization/20240725.md#scs-compatible-iaas-v5-end-of-aug)
- update standard images, see PR [standards/#682](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/682)
    - include Ubuntu 24.04
    - move "mandatory" from 22.04 to 24.04
    - add "recommended" to Debian 12
    - namescheme problem with `ubuntu-capi-image v[0-9]\\.[0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+)?` -- Team Container doesn't like the space (because of command-line UX), their scripts don't use the space (so they will upload an image if the dash-variant isn't found), but OpenStack Image Manager [does use space](https://osism.tech/docs/guides/operations-guide/openstack/tools/image-manager/#image-without-regular-rebuild) and [nothing else](https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/blob/main/openstack_image_manager/main.py#L518) to separate name from version
    - image manager extension is [in the works](https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/issues/821) as we speak
    - images (1) used in KaaS, (2) recommend in standards, and (3) implemented via image manager should be in sync
- Q: document final state of project?
    - idea: introduce v6 by end of this year
    - counteridea: avoid too high a pace, postpone v5 until November
    - decision: proceed with "counteridea", v5 in November

#### Stabilize SCS-compatible KaaS v1

sponsor: @mbuechse

- both standards that v1 refers to are deficient
    - [K8s version policy](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0210-v2-k8s-version-policy#decision) doesn't seem to work for PS?
        - "The latest patch version MUST be provided no later than 1 week after release."
        - PS says they need 5 business days for their testing
        - @jschoone did some informal polling: gut feeling is that 2 weeks should work
        - decision: change it to 2 weeks
    - [Node distribution](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0214-v2-k8s-node-distribution) doesn't seem practical, in particular the new `host-id` label, see [this comment](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/639#issuecomment-2276017422)
        - the `host-id` labels should not be used for any scheduling
        - potential solution is still waiting for upstream approval
        - so long as we can be sure that a solution exists, go ahead with our current approach, including the ad-hoc setting of the `host-id` labels just for the test

#### CNCF conformance

sponsor: @mbuechse

- I see two general approaches:
    1. we include the official sonobuoy tests into our SCS checks and evaluate the results
    2. CSP has to send their results to [k8s-conformance](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance) repository, and we only check there
- Q: which approach would be preferred?
    - no 2 could be appropriate for managed Kubernetes providers
    - leave no 1 as an option for other cases (potentially also to verify no 2)
- practical question:
    - how to proceed with providers that don't use CAPI / central api?
    - request long-lived Kubeconfig OR request some kind of plug-in that does the creation and teardown of a test cluster for us

#### Release notes R7, section on Standardization

sponsor: @mbuechse

- for inspiration, see [list of closed R7 issues](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22R7+%28v8.0.0%29%22+is%3Aclosed)
- discussion:
    - write more than one short sentence :)
    - partners that don't use the reference impl (since May)
