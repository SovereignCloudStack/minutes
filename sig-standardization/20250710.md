- @fkr (only for scs-0004 & scs-0007)

### Housekeeping

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @mbuechse: check with C&H folks what is planned about the Fitko demonstrator_
  - evaluation ongoing
- _AI @mbuechse: create issue for drafting a new standard regarding self-description_
  - open
- _AI @mbuechse: create issue for new version of volume backup standard (snapshots etc.)_
  - open
- _AI @fkr & @depressiveRobot: check with Lisa regarding presentation of certificates on website_
  - ongoing
- _AI @fkr & @depressiveRobot: develop an idea on how to optimize the presentation of certified CSPs_
  - open

### Agenda

#### Finalize discussions on scs-0004 certification revocation

sponsor: @fkr

- We should finalize our discussions on [scs-0004](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0004-v1-achieving-certification), since @fkr wants to bring the adjustments to the Forum's call on July 4th
- see https://input.scs.community/2025-scs-sig-standardization?view#certification-revocation-if-testschecks-fail
- open questions
  - are weekly tests sufficient?
    - resource consumption of testing is negligible
    - we want to stick with current timings
  - what to do about the `99.x %`?
    - "the automated tests MUST pass 99.x % of the runs" -> "the automated tests MUST successfully run again as quickly as possible"
- _AI @depressiveRobot create issue/PR with proposal_

#### Let's merge scs-0007 Certified SCS Integrators

sponsor: @fkr

- Let's merge https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/946 - objections?
  - Supplement with notes on meeting exclusion ([PR #964](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/964) was merged into it already)
- _AI @depressiveRobot merge it and create new PR for stabilization_
	- Final stabilization will go to Forum once more
 
#### Certification of CSPs

sponsor: @depressiveRobot & @fkr

- [continued from last time](https://input.scs.community/2025-scs-sig-standardization?both#Certification-of-CSPs)
- Is a tick for the manual checks sufficient or do we want certain proof? (like logs)
  - two favorable opinions for certain proof in last Forums call on 2025-07-04
- what is with the _Certificate Revocation List (CRL)_?
  - https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0004-v1-achieving-certification/#regulations #7
  - currently a handful of CSPs, so for a first version a manually edited page/list would be sufficient
- Test suite optimizations
  - link to standard on detailed test report page
    - for example the [page](https://compliance.sovereignit.cloud/page/report/add421b1-c4a5-430f-8703-7829fb6fbf6a#36bf5106-c217-453c-bf62-d1e2e6d33853) is missing link/reference to [tested standard](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0101-v1-entropy#entropy-in-scs-clouds)
  - [full report](https://compliance.sovereignit.cloud/page/report_full/add421b1-c4a5-430f-8703-7829fb6fbf6a#36bf5106-c217-453c-bf62-d1e2e6d33853) should output debug message indicating beginning of specific test case
    - currently only: `DEBUG: Checking images and flavors for recommended attributes`
    - nice-to-have: `DEBUG: Running "entropy-check-image-properties"` and `DEBUG: Running "entropy-check-flavor-properties"`
  - sounds good, let's do this

#### OpenStack powered compute deprecation

sponsor: @depressiveRobot

- In last Forums call on 2025-07-04 the question was raised if OpenStack powered compute is still state-of-the-art?
- currently part of SCS-compatible IaaS checks
- tempest tests executed with `refstack`
	- tempest and tempest tests continue to exist
	- refstack no longer maintained, server to upload test results to no longer running
	- guideline with listing of all required tests: https://opendev.org/openinfra/interop
- options
  - custom set of tests we think are reasonable for SCS
  - get in touch with upstream / other companies using OpenStack to establish new test suite together
  - drop it from SCS-compatible IaaS
	- this would fit a change in the standardization strategy to define more meta-standard (with abstract requirements)
- For now: create an SCS tempest test list and invite others to join

#### Flavors with larger memory

sponsor: @fkr & @depressiveRobot

- PR [standards#938](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/938)
- results from survey among partners
  - C&H has 64 GiB of RAM on offer and is the fourth most frequently used
  - at ScaleUp, 32GiB are the third most popular
- suggestion:
  - add larger memory flavors with 64 and 128 GiB of RAM as recommended
  - With which CPU/RAM ratio?
    - 1:2, 1:4, 1:8
- options:
  - ~~disagree with the suggestion~~
  - ~~disregard recommendation~~
  - recommend to offer larger flavors
    - with brief explanation what "recommended" means
    - _AI @berendt change flavor manager to only create recommended flavors below a parameterized memory limit_
      - parameter should default to current value of 32 GiB
      - https://github.com/osism/openstack-flavor-manager/issues/146
    - _AI @depressiveRobot adjust [PR#938](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/938) accordingly_
