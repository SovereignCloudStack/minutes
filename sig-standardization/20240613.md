### Housekeeping

#### Designate people to transfer minutes and report in community call

- @garloff

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @mbuechse and @fdobrovolny: move [issues/#332](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/332) forward_
    - open
- _AI @josephineSei: write mail to list with specific date where there's no conflict with lean operator coffee or similar_
    - open
- _AI @mbuechse: write issue to relax test script and introduce new version of scs-0103_
    - test script: see [standards/#574](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/574)
    - new version: see [standards/#594](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/594) and PR [standards/#630](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/630)
- _AI @mbuechse: draft a mechanism for the certificate-scope yaml to declare parameters for standards_
    - see [standards/#592](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/592) and PR [standards/#595](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/595)
- _AI @mxmxchere to collect opinions from @frosty-geek and possibly others about keeping CAPI image recent_
    - done; it was ultimately decided in the Product Board that the CAPI image shall remain a recommendation only (see [this comment](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/582#discussion_r1624760704))
    - still open: document decision

### Agenda 

#### Generally allow `scs:name-vN` extra specs

sponsor: @mbuechse; time: 3 min

- see [standards/#574](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/574) and [standards/#594](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/594)
- open to discuss:
    - can multiple flavors have the same property value?
    - do we want to allow multiple property values for the same flavor?
- _AI @mbuechse: inject into Team IaaS_

#### Should we standardize instance metadata?

sponsor: @berendt; time: 10 min

- see [standards/#580](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/580)
- open to discuss:
    - yes, it could be desirable to standardize certain behaviour (within namespaces or so?)
    - Provider -> Customer information
    - Customer -> Provider wanted operational behavior
- _AI @mbuechse: inject into Team IaaS_

#### Check on lingering open PRs

sponsor: @mbuechse; time: 5 min

- some(!) PRs seem to be dormant or taking a long time
- please everyone check whether you have a lingering PR
- [list of open PRs](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen)
- _AI @mbuechse: send message on scs-tech list with an "ultimatum": old PRs are going to be closed if nothing happens_

#### Update table of compliant clouds

sponsor: @mbuechse; time: 5 min

- see PR [standards/#600](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/600)
- suggestion by @mbuechse: CSPs have known for a while, maybe set a date and send out a 'last call' (final warning) via the scs-tech list?
- Decision: put link to the failing run into the table (if possible)
    - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/actions/workflows/check-gx-scs-v2.yml leads to the overall checks page (sadly not the latest)
    - syntax for embedding: [![Compliance Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/SovereignCloudStack/standards/check-gx-scs-v2.yml?label=v2%20compliant)](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/actions/workflows/check-gx-scs-v2.yml)
- Decision: Will need to merge this soon
    - _AI @mbuechse: put on the agenda for next time (June 27)_
- Decision: Short term measure: Mention used version

#### Mechanism for formal grace period

sponsor: @mbuechse; time: 15 min

- see issue [standards/#591](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/591), in particular [this comment](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/591#issuecomment-2144875858)
    - avoid `obsolete`/`deprecate` --> maybe use `warn_at`
- Automation to avoid too much human judgement
- Note: we might need more "grace" in the future (tolerate when a certain ratio of the standards is not satisfied, but be very transparent about it)
- Medium-term future: More generic mechanism to make single exceptions/deviations transparent?

#### Procedural

- many agenda items remaining, also the question whether June 27 will work for people due to school holidays
- _AI @mbuechse: check whether we need to use an overflow slot_
