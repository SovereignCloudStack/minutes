#### Certification topics for 2026

sponsor: @mbuechse

- avoid surprises or marketing problems when new scope version is published
  - announce new version early so applicants know that it is going to come
  - maybe even use regular schedule (every April or so)
  - offer upgrade path for partners who are already certified
  - check language ("deprecation") and/or extend overlapping period
  - certificate shows version (consensus after comprehensive discussion), but badge doesn't (and the badge is what most people see)
  - _AI Team start revising docs_
- revise suite of certifications
  - Product cert
  - Integrator cert
  - Incubator cert
  - Consultancy cert
- revise application and assessment process
  - add some kind of stress test
- test suite development
  - improve UX (ATM two scripts w/wildly different syntax)
  - finally tackle [standards#941](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/941) and [standards#942](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/942)
- compliance monitor development
  - ...
- compliance monitor deployment
  - secrets handling that allows for self-service of CSPs
  - either add a vault instance (maybe even to the docker-compose file)
  - or add feature to compliance monitor itself
- improve involvement of partners!
