### Agenda

#### Terminology "certificate subject" in SCS vs. X509 meaning

- discussion in [standards/#347](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/347), which so far suggests the following options:
    - certificate type
    - certificate subject
    - certificate topic
    - certificate scope
- please participate!
- Decision: "certificate scope"
- To Do: Use the term consistently
    - _AI @mbuechse: adjust scs-0003 (type->scope)_
    - _AI @maxwolfs and others: adjust docs page (subject->scope), input from @garloff/@alexander-diab_

#### Documentation of standards and certs on docs-page

- Draft available in [PR 76](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/76)
    - Have a look at the [preview deployment](https://docs-staging.scs.community/standards)
    - Text should be revised, do this within #76
    - _AI @garloff: to ensure that @maxwolfs has the latest from @alexander-diab_

#### Better differentiation between DR and standards

- Differentiation between Decision Records (DR) and Standards [#352](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/352)
    - Template not working well for Decision Records
        (format, version, ...): needs different secionts
        - Suggestion: Create a new template for ADRs (@markus-hentsch, @cah-baum)
    - Numbering without conflicts: ADR scs-0501-v1, Std scs-0502-v1, ADR scs-0501-v2, Std scs-0502-v2, Std scs-0502-v3
    - Recommendation: Keep changelog/journal for minor/editorial changes

#### Prioritizing KaaS standardization topics

- Epic KaaS standards [#181](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/181)
- Priorization criteria:
    - How important to standardize? (How often do applications need changes when moving between k8s clusters?)
    - How ready are we to standardize this? (Do we understand it well enough? Can we implement it in our reference implementation?)
- Preparation meeting planned @jschoone, @mbuechse, @cah-baum, @garloff

#### Prioritizing IaaS standardization topics

- Epic IaaS standards [#285](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/285)
- Priorization criteria: Same as above
- _AI: @fkr will organize a preparation meeting_
