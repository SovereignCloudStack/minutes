### Agenda

#### Introduction Workstream 2

sponsor: @fkr

- Workstream 2 is one out of three workstreams concluded at the physical meeting of the Forum SCS-Standards. The overall topic of workstream 2 is: 
- Workstream 2: Standardization requirements from workloads (Felix+Martin)
  - motivation: people who want to migrate from hyperscalers to open tech keep asking about database services and other platform services
  - this work is happening anyway, could (easily?) be standardized
  - SCS standards on IaaS and KaaS layer were always meant to support deploying platform services (cf. requirement for low-latency non-replicated (local) storage, e.g., SSDs)
  - Collect and prioritize PaaS workloads
  - Understand infra requirements, compare with existing standards, identify gaps
  - Using SCS Lab to test workloads (incl. Fachverfahren)
  - technical discussions in the SIG possible in principle, with potential break-out sessions
  - we need to work from concrete toward abstract instead of the other way around -- reach out to implementing companies that have experience with platform services already
    - Enrico (stackXperts) - DB (and others)
    - OpenDesk deploys a database
    - dNation database engineering
    - C&H builds a DB-aaS service currently
    - syseleven has DB-aaS (pgnative based)
  - next meeting will include engineer Matej from dNation
  - _AI @fkr: ask Enrico to join next week's call_

#### Open pull requests

sponsor: @mbuechse

- [PR #898](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/898)
  - Looks like an SDK bug to me (@garloff) ... the PR is a workaround
  - Hundreds of secrets in the tested clouds ... [Issue #896](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/896)
  - fixing upstream (where the data model is arguably flawed) would take quite long, but should be done
  - assuming that an openstack client would just send DELETE requests to whatever href it is handed in a `secret` (or other Barbican) resource, the client could be exploited to send spurious deletes; however, the openstack client doesn't seem to support deletion, and the OSC plugin directly asks the user for the href
  - _AI @gtema: fix it in the SDK without breaking our workaround?_

#### Open issues

sponsor: @mbuechse

- Getting artcodix back into compliance ... (3mins)
  - image properties (@mbuechse, @garloff -> @cschwaller)
  - flavor properties for entropy (@garloff -> @cschwaller), optional
  - Removing/Renaming volumes in "backing up" state (@mbuechse, @cschwaller)
