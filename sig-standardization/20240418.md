### Housekeeping

#### Designate people to transfer minutes and report in community call

- @martinmo

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @mbuechse and @fdobrovolny: move [issues/#332](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/332) forward_
    - open
- _AI: put license topic on agenda for May 16_
    - open (keep until then)

### Agenda

#### place for findings regarding cost of making yaook scs-compatible

sponsor: @mbuechse

- @cah-hbaum has [collected findings](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/do-not-merge/scs-compliant-yaook/Informational/) regarding the cost of [making yaook scs-compatible](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/426)
- some of it is general and can go into the respective implementation notes
    - yes
- some of it is yaook-specific (or rather OpenStack generic) -- where should it go?
    - there are multiple entities that use Yaook
    - so put a guide somewhere on the SCS docs page (next to all the other guides) under "How to configure my OpenStack cloud so that it becomes SCS compliant"
    - be specific: include working shell code, screen shots etc. (may be yaook-specific)
- Hint: image-manager and flavor-manager from OSISM should work on most OpenStack clouds, so they don't need to be rewritten for yaook-managed OpenStack clouds
- as an aside: this effort was very valuable because we found many bits and pieces here and there with ideas for improvements (just to substantiate our hypothesis that having a second implementation next to the reference implementation is a very good thing)
    - for instance, the flavor tests don't really check all advertised properties
    - maybe use the health monitor to gather data for the compliance check
    - monitoring would be part of scs-sovereign (as opposed to scs-compatible)

#### Create v2 of node distribution standard

sponsor: @mbuechse

- extending [scs-0214-v1](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0214-v1-k8s-node-distribution), issue: [standards/#494](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/494), PR: [standards/#524](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/524)
- it's unclear as yet when the labelling of hostid can be implemented (at least with KaaSv2, where it needs to be in capo)
- until then, and as a stop-gap measure, we can make an openstack-specific test that queries the underlying openstack
    - non-OpenStack implementations would need to contribute their own test

adjacent questions:

- the standard currently states that it is optional as a whole, and that is probably not quite what we intended
    - we wanted to admit the possibility where all clusters share a control plane (and this then would still be distributed in a failsafe way; use namespacing to separate tenants, but as the individual control nodes can not be accessed by users, we can't easily verify this)
        - if the shared control plane cannot be enumerated, maybe the script can just say "pass" whenever fewer than 2 control plane nodes are found?
        - a second script that needs more privileges could be added (in the worst case we would ask for a conformity statement and have the right to do manual checks)
    - rephrase "Since some providers only have small environments to work with and therefore couldn't comply with this standard, it will be treated as a RECOMMENDED standard, where providers can OPT OUT."?
- failure zones are not defined, so the corresponding requirement is a bit vacuous
    - we might say that we assume that failure zone is the same as availability zone, but the latter term still needs to be defined in an SCS standard
    - for the time being, we have separate physical nodes, which is already something
