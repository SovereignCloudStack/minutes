### Agenda
* Summarizing last weeks discussion: Teams drive standards, SIG std supports with process, editorial, ...
* Synchronizing standards with reference implementation releases?
  - @frosty-geeks argues that new standards should always become effective with new releases (within the 4--6 weeks that we require the providers to move to the latest release)
  - @garloff thinks that occasionally we formally codify existing standards which are already implemented in the reference implementation and used by existing SCS-conformant providers and which may thus become effective outside of that window
  - We should never make a standard effective (i.e. mandatory to be SCS-compliant) before it is implemented in the SCS reference implementation
  - We need a strong feedback loop with SCS providers to ensure the buy-in before standards are being decided and made effective => provider group needs to decide with a certain quorum?
  - Publication dates / rhythm for communication purposes

* ADR 0001
  - Rendered doc (draft): https://github.com/cloudandheat/scs-docs/blob/scs-0001/Standards/scs-0001-sovereign-cloud-standards.md
  - PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/pull/143
  - Lacks an effective date -> q: is stabilized_at ment for this?
idea: add a meta document listing all current standards and when said "stable" document (incl. version) will be effective. 
  - Lack an optional section "relation to other standards"

* SSD flavor for etcd (effective 2023-04-30?)
  - Early draft: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/blob/feat/add-ssd-flavor-adr/Decisions/scs-xxxx-v1-ssd-flavors.md

* Collaboration on Flavor naming and flavor transparency SCS with upstream standardization (OpenStack public cloud SIG)
