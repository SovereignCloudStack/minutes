### Housekeeping

#### Designate people to transfer minutes and report in community call

- @mbuechse

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @anjastrunk: Create issues regarding C&H implementation (one epic issue and separate issues for each standard)_
    - open
- _AI @mbuechse and @fdobrovolny: move [issues/#332](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/332) forward_
    - open

### Agenda

#### Recap of the Community Hackathon (@mbuechse et al.)

The topic was: general overview, value proposition, current state

- benefits
  - interoperability, viable deployment targets for ISVs
  - share/establish best practices for operation (sometimes as recommendations)
  - publish a list of companies who use SCS-compliant clouds in production
  - also: SCS compliance increasingly beneficial in public bidding processes
- cost: how hard is it to be compliant?
  - include implementation guide into the template (not step-by-step tutorial, but config file templates etc.)
- how to handle recommendations
  - always produce warnings for recommendations that are not met IF they can be tested easily enough
  - explain that recommendations are candidates for mandates
- further ideas
  - also include standards under development into test suite to give CSPs an idea whether they need to speak up
  - also provide support for users of SCS clouds: tell them to what degree they use non-standard features
      - do not aim at completeness here (infeasible)
      - could look at a running workload and what resources it uses
  - alternative: central API
      - might not solve the problem if it allows CSP-specific extensions (it will probably offer all flavors, not merely mandatory SCS flavors; could be opt-in)
      - idea is to allow for innovation on the end of CSPs

- _AI @mbuechse: write an issue to draft Implementation and Testing Notes additional accompanying document as a kind of preview of what this could look like_

#### Distinguishing editorial status and effectiveness status for standards and certification subject versions

- editorial status vs. effectiveness status for *standards*
    - field `status` can take on `Proposal`, `Draft`, `Stable`, `Deprecated`, or `Rejected`
    - a `Stable` standard can have a `stabilized_on` in the future, a `Deprecated` standard can have a `deprecated_on` in the future
    - this results in **three states regarding effectiveness**: not-yet-effective (`Stable`, but `stabilized_on` in the future), effective (`Stable`, `stabilized_on` not in the future, no `deprecated_on`), soon-to-be-deprecated (`Deprecated`, `stabilized_on` not in the future, `deprecated_on` in the future)
    - alternative wording?: ineffective-stable, effective-stable, effective-deprecated
- editorial status vs. effectiveness status for *certification scope versions*
    - no such field `status` exists, but `stabilized_on` can be not present, in the future, or not in the future, and likewise for `deprecated_on`
    - this results in the same three states regarding effectiveness as for standards
- decision/_AI @mbuechse: use four columns (with asterisk for explanation)_
    - draft
    - stable (but not yet effective)
    - effective 
    - deprecated (and no longer effective)
- _AI @mbuechse: write an issue to add some (redundant) color coding with appropriate contrast ratios_
