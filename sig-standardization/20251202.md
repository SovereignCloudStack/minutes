### Number of SCS documents in PRs

sponsor: @depressiveRobot

- SCS-0001 says that [only one SCS document is allowed per pull request](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0001-v1-sovereign-cloud-standards#proposal-phase)
- there can be situations where additional SCS documents (decision record or supplement) are necessary next to a new standard or procedural
- was not adjusted at the time when `Supplement` was introduced
- proposal: "The pull request [for the proposal] MUST add exactly one SCS document of the type `Standard`, `Procedural` or `Decision Record`, in the `Standards` folder. It MAY add additional SCS documents of the type `Supplement`.

### OpenStack powered compute and how to continue here

sponsor: @fkr & @depressiveRobot

- we bring a suggestion on how to proceed with the current certifications as well as going forward
  - suggestion from Freerk how to run the tempest tests is working
  - Details in [issue #990](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/990) and [PR #1010](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/1010)
  - alternative ways to run the same set of tempest tests are acceptable, simplification available by @toothstone
  - time is ticking to deliver the results for some CSPs!

### Create v2 of scs-0104-standard-images

sponsor: @mbuechse

- PR [standards#989](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/989)
  - please review!
  - please also review user docs from [PR docs/#326](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/326)
  - SCS CAPI images URL needs to be updated
- potential misunderstanding about `image_source` property?

### SCS-0007 Incubator status

sponsor: @depressiveRobot

- Issue: [standards#1024](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/1024)
- PR: [standards#1026](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/1026)
- goal: get rid of voting to avoid social pressure
- should we "normalize" Incubator (dedicated certificate, renewal permissible), because it may take longer than a year?
  - audience agrees
  - certification based on scoring for clarity
- should we add SCS-approved Consultant for people (rather: legal entities!) who are very knowledgeable, but will never meet the requirements of Integrator
  - potentially separate standard (not -0007)
- further open questions
  - How do we want to handle joint references? (e.g. two or more partners have jointly set up SCS environments or manage them together)
  - How to prove that the environment is not "scripted only"?
    - maybe some kind of plausibility checks and statistics (customers, applications, workloads, stress tests etc.)
  - in both cases: the assessment body's job and mandate need to be specified in such a way that it can really vet the viability of the applicant beyond just a simple fixed checklist
    - for joint work, what is the own contribution of the applicant and is it indeed worthy/significant
    - also check that the test subject is more than a tech demo, for example by utilizing a stress test
    - maybe we can split into three categories here:
      - self assessment
        - should ask relevant questions about how certain criteria are implemented and needs to be filled by the company that wants to be certified
      - codified checks
        - should check if the fixed criteria are fulfilled (e.g. api checks or test certain deployments on top) and can be run either by the company that wants to be certified or the auditor
      - auditor
        - should audit based on the input from the two categories mentioned above (self assessment and codified checks) and clear up any inconsistencies
