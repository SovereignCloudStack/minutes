### Agenda

#### Current state of compliance

sponsor: @mbuechse

- we had a few red badges after 2025-01-07 due to expired credentials
- these have been resolved
  - thanks to @berendt for renewing credentials for regio-a
  - thanks to @garloff (not the partner CSPs!) for renewing credentials for pco-prodN and wavestack
- questions
  - what is the pros/cons trade-off for having time-restricted credentials?
  - decision: whoever delivers the credential shall also deliver renewed credentials if necessary
  - decision: have Github actions run out (by end of June)
  - @gtema suggests to use Vault so app creds can be rotated more easily by means of some OpenID access (depending on the future deployment of Vault and who's going to maintain it); keep this topic in mind (mid-term)
- poc-kdo cannot be tested because of an expired SSL certificate on their end --> red badge
  - POC expired overall
  - _AI @mbuechse remove from table_ (also remove secrets & actions)
- 8 out of 12 green badges do not satisfy v5.1, for various reasons:
  - gx-scs: volume-backup-check FAILING due to ERROR `waiting for resource 424851a8-721b-48de-acde-8dfdf19981c5 to be in status ('available', 'error') (current: error_restoring)`
  - aov-cloud: multiple problems, but it's still WIP anyway
  - pco-prodN: service-apis-check MISSING due to CRITICAL `An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the ListBuckets operation: Unknown`
  - poc-wgcloud: multiple known problems, also WIP (simple misconfiguration of key-manager, missing volume-backup service, missing octavia, missing object-store)
  - wavestack: service-apis-check MISSING due to CRITICAL `An error occurred (InvalidAccessKeyId) when calling the ListBuckets operation: None`
- questions
  - is our S3 test too fragile, or are the environments ill-configured?

#### Domain-manager requirement potentially problematic

sponsor: @fkr

- apparently, SysEleven (among others?) only uses ONE domain in total for all customers (difficult to change without fiddling with the databases directly)
- therefore, the requirement is not useful/sensible
- take this into the next meeting
- _AI @mbuechse: talk about manual tests/documentation requirements/audits once again_

#### Open pull requests

sponsor: @mbuechse

- we're doing it live: [list of open PRs, most recently updated first](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
- talk about open issues next time
- table this item for lack of time

#### Meeting slot / next meeting

sponsor: @mbuechse

- cadence: weekly
- keep Thursday slot for the time being
