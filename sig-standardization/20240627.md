### Housekeeping

#### Designate people to transfer minutes and report in community call

- @martinmo

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @mbuechse and @fdobrovolny: move [issues/#332](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/332) forward_
    - open
- _AI @josephineSei: write mail to list with specific date where there's no conflict with lean operator coffee or similar_
    - has been dealt with: meeting was 23.05.24
    - Taxonomy of failsafe levels PR has @martinmo working on it for KaaS
- _AI @mbuechse: move PR [standards/#582](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/582) forward_
    - still wip
- _AI @mbuechse: inject [standards/#594](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/594) into Team IaaS_
    - done: meeting of 2024-06-26
- _AI @mbuechse: inject [standards/#580](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/580) into Team IaaS_
    - done: meeting of 2024-06-26
- _AI @mbuechse: send message on scs-tech list with an "ultimatum": old PRs are going to be closed if nothing happens_
    - done differently: I directly commented in the PRs in question
- _AI @mbuechse: put PR [standards/#600](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/600) on the agenda for next time (June 27)_
    - done
- _AI @mbuechse: check whether we need to use an overflow slot_
    - open

### Agenda

#### Updating certification table to v4

sponsor: @mbuechse

- see PR [standards/#600](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/600)
    - update this branch to specify version in each badge
    - also (re)state region where applicable
- postpone this PR, discuss ultimate problem: why don't CSPs seem to care?
    - is it the case that they aren't interested?
    - or is it merely the case they need some more prodding/nudging? (then being red or orange might help)
    - does the matrix have sufficient exposure at all?
    - do we need to improve operator experience for people who want to ensure compliance?
    - NB: two environments that use the ref impl are NOT on the current version, so human-power missing?
    - which standards are the main obstacles?
- we might show multiple badges (best compliant version, compliance of current version)
- _AI @fkr: query CSPs to check our hypotheses above, in order to prepare a break-out session_

#### How to check conformant clouds for their extended conformance (SHOULDs are fulfilled) 

sponsor: @josephineSei / @anjastrunk

- there are standards with "SHOULD" statements. Some of those SHOULDs will never be transformend into a MUST.
- How can a customer know whether a conformant cloud also fulfills all SHOULDs in all standards, or only parts of them or none of them?
    - e.g., it could be interesting to know whether encryption-related recommendations are being satisfied
- an analogue of https://www.bestpractices.dev/en or similar can be used that issues a _badge with "score"_ (that may be even aggregated over multiple categories)
    - example: https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/1
    - be careful not to compute an average for security-related features
- or: have each environment offer a manifest (or signed GX self-description) that includes details about features that are being offered
    - Gaia-X could be a little complex?
    - however, we will have a blog-post to demystify GX: https://staging.scs.community/website/2024/06/05/demystifying-gaia-x-credentials/
    - also, we will have an SD generator tool to make operator's life easier: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/gx-credential-generator/
- we could also offer multiple orthogonal certificate scopes, where some certificate makes some assertions mandatory, while other certificates don't (or we have to partition the standards more)
- _AI @mbuechse: try to arrange for a break-out session_
