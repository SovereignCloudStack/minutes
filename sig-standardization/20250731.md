### Agenda

#### `os_purpose` in scs-0102 (image metadata)

sponsor: @mbuechse/@garloff

- current state
- PR [standards#970](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/970) no longer draft
- reviewers in favor, but we want some more community feedback
- _AI reminder mail next week_

#### Concept for a certification website

sponsor: @mbuechse

- create a website that contains
  - certificate revocation list (CRL)
  - certification details pages
- have the freedom to
  - shape content manually (CRL)
  - mirror content from certificate monitor service (details pages), potentially with amendments
- added bonus: additional robustness (similar to docs page that continues to work even if compliance monitor happens to be down)
- discussion
  - current docs page could be used for prototyping phase
  - target audience (procurement people) will however need something separate from the developer-oriented docs page
  - sovereigncloudstack.org could also be used (for prototyping as well as later on)
  - _AI include this issue into general discussion w/Lisa_
