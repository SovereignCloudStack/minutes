### Rancher and SCS-compatible KaaS

sponsor: @fkr

- Torsten Hallmann from SuSE joined today
- goal is to provide an SCS-compatible KaaS with Rancher
- challenge might be [scs-0210](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0210-v2-k8s-version-policy) (k8s version policy)
  - minor version after 4 months is no problem
  - patch version after 2 weeks is a challenge
    - more time is needed for hardening/QA
    - goals for critical CVEs are under review
- roadmap
  - currently revising parts of v1 (cf. [standards#982](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/982))
  - feedback can be incorporated into the next version of SCS-compatible KaaS (then v2)
  - no fixed date, but probably no earlier than February 2026

### Create v2 of scs-0104-standard-images

sponsor: @mbuechse

- draft PR [standards#989](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/989)
  - please review!
- major simplification of the text!
- move away from YAML file, move away from static definition
- instead: "latest LTS, no later than April 30" and "latest stable, no later than one month after release"
- keep recommending the previously mandatory name *for now*
- URL discussion
  - same capi image name should have same content
    - use different name for different image
  - maybe the regiocloud URL is not acceptable for everyone?
    - use registry.scs.community ?
- _AI @mbuechse: ask chrisschwa what his actual intention was_

### IPv6 support for IaaS

sponsor: @fzakfeld

- technical standardization of IPv6 for IaaS
- implementation [issues#166](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/166)
- epic [#285](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/285) should link IPv6 issue with problem description and definition of done
- _AI @fzakfeld: create issue and draft a standard on IPv6 networking for IaaS_

### S3 feature standardization

sponsor: @toothstone

- technical standardization of a specification for S3 API object storage
- [standards#1003](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/1003)
- S3 url from the service catalog entry for Swift is not ideal, but apparently not a real pain point
- there is a need for a standardization of S3 features
- Suggestion: Find the intersection of
  - common features from OSS implementations
  - common needs from users
- see linked issue for more details
- _AI @toothstone: write down minimum set of features in issue_
- _AI @depressiveRobot: send mail to lists to open discussion_
