#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @fkr: include CSPs and public-cloud sig into discussion (about domain manager)_
  - done

  - done (work will be postponed by 2 weeks though)

### Agenda

#### Standardization of domain manager role

sponsor: @fkr

As discussed in previous meetings, @fkr was to reach out to various CSPs in order to make sure to discuss the [domain manager role](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0302-v1-domain-manager-role/) topic in appropiate depth.

Following people have confirmed that they will show up:

- @maliblatt
- @matfechner
- @gtema
- possible people from Cleura

- In addition, some CSPs have outsourced user management almost completely to an external IdP (e.g. keycloak)
- Self-management of users (and groups and projects) is desirable ...
- Quotas: Setting quotas on domains is meanwhile possible (not well-documented, may have corner cases left)
- Historically some providers just do it differently ...
    - Somehow record that several projects that belong to a customer ...
        - E.g. some external IdP
        - Naming conventions
    - Legal reasons may exist to exclude local users when an external IdP is used instead
- Use cases
    - Allow the same approach to self-management across SCS clouds
    - E.g. health-monitor would like to create a separate project for the test resources ...
- Migrating towards domains usage
    - The domain concept as a feature is always enabled in OpenStack
    - Domains are an identity-only concept (users, groups, projects, role-assignments)
    - Gradual migration possible: onboard new customers to customer-specific domains (instead of global default domain)
        - could leave old customers where they are for a while
        - granting domain-manager role for customers that need self-service
        - user managment may still go via an external IdP
- Domain-Manager value proposition for users:
    - Offer *standardized* self-service APIs (i.e. OpenStack APIs) for managing
        - users (create/delete, dis/enable)
        - groups (create/delete, assign/remove users)
        - role-assignments (to users and/or groups)
        - projects
    - This may be limited by federation (external IdP)
    - Customer Management Portal
        - run by IAM folks that may not understand OpenStack concepts well
        - provider-specifc (non-standardized)
- Policy discussion needed
    - What do we want to mandate (for SCS compliance) now?
    - What in the future?
    - What may remain desirable (recommended)?
- To be continued **in 2 weeks** (SIG Std/Cert)
    - Ideally with strawman proposal(s) -> @gtema

#### Compliance monitor deployment

sponsor: @mbuechse

- [compliance monitor](https://compliance.sovereignit.cloud/page/table) has been down since Monday
- apparently, the instance has been stopped
- according to @garloff, scs1 has to be vacated
- migration to scs2 is required
- side-topic: shall things be migrated from Wavestack as well?
  - Vault has been moved to Cleura already
  - Zuul still to be done
  - same for Keycloak (maybe to CNDS?)
- redeploy from scratch, but dump SQL and import on new machine, use this to establish backup procedures
- migrate to k8s in a second step
