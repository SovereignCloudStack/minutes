### Agenda
#### Standards under review
* Certification levels https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/pull/148
	-> Please review! To be discussed next week
* ADR local storage flavors in review until EOW: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/pull/150
	-> IaaS team, to be merged after EOW (if no further significant request needs discussion)
* Choice of Identity https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/pull/144
* Machine Identities: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/pull/140

#### ADR-0001 is not completely clear how a std/adr moves from draft to stabilized
* Combination of active approvals from "core team" plus lack of vetos/unresolved suggestions within a certain timeframe
	- "Core team" would be people nominated by the product board (and be depending on the track)
	- Asking for suggestions on mailing list when we open the PR
	- Time depends on the complexity/scope, to be decided by PB (weeks ~ months)
	- Mention in Thu team call
* Merge (with status draft) happens before this
* Do this next Mon (2022-11-21) for  ADR-0001 and Local-Storage ADR
* Stabilized standards may become part of certification requirements (and thus mandatory) by being referenced in certification metadata doc (see PR #148)
