- (none)

### Agenda

#### introduce image property `os_purpose`

sponsor: @mbuechse

- PR [standards#970](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/970)
- people had plenty of time and multiple invitations to comment
- so, we should merge this now
  - however, the check script needs to be adapted
  - however^2, this script is currently being revamped in a [concurrent PR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/975), and merging could be a little painful
  - let's finish the latter PR soon-ish (e.g. coming Tuesday), then rebase PR 970
- _AI @garloff create PR for openstack-image-manager_

#### Secure Connections Standard scs-0125

sponsor: @mbuechse

- see https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0125-v1-secure-connections
- currently draft
- _AI @mbuechse: run test script against current partners_
- find out whether testbed install of reference impl satisfies this standard ALSO beyond automated tests (otherwise this won't fly)
  - _AI @mbuechse: create a check list and then ask the vendors (OSISM, ALASCA) whether this is currently feasible_
- Note that test script only checks a small part of the standard (the publicly accessible interfaces), manual checks/declarations required

#### SCS-compatible KaaS provisioning API

sponsor: @mbuechse

- (continued from last meeting)
- recap
  - two distinct areas of standardization:
    - what do the clusters look like
    - cluster management (create, scale, upgrade, destroy etc.)
  - so far, we focused on the former
  - the latter could arguably be viewed as a third "layer"
    1. SCS-compatible IaaS
    2. SCS-compatible KaaS
    3. SCS-compatible KaaS management
  - seems _muy importante_ to get rid of vendor lock-in
    - how else are people supposed to migrate from one KaaS provider to the next?
- discussion
  - cluster management is politically ambitious (multiple different APIs, no consensus on a common API - Gardener vs OpenShift vs Rancher vs ClusterAPI)
  	- abstraction layer?
  - many customers work with long-lived clusters, have no pressing need to use a standardized API for life-cycle managing ... clusters
  - we could standardize "third layer" above, maybe even name the layer specifically after the technology, such as `SCS-compatible ClusterStacks`
