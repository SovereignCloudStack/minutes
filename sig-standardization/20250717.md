#### Getting rid of mandatory image names

sponsor: @garloff

- Blog article in preparation
- Just filting with `--property os_distro=XXX --property os_version=YYY` does not yields unique results on real clouds
	- This can be due to old images (which however should be hidden, so this is an operator mistake)
	- This can be due to special images, e.g. the ubuntu-capi-image ...
		- These rightfully carry the `os_distro` and `os_version` properties.
		- We had suggested to introduce the `os_original=True` (or `os_vanilla=True`) property.
			- We need to do this **now** (add to the standard as recommended at least) if we want to get rid of prescribed names not too far in the future
			- Now: Add as recommendation to [scs-0102](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0102-v1-image-metadata#technical-requirements-and-features), not a new version required
			- Now: Add a add WARNING to the compliance tests
			- Now: Add to image-manager metadata
			- Next month: Reach out to providers to implement
			- Next month: Blog article, announcing intention and explaining how to instruct tools to still find images => This is the point of no return, so take a decision here before doing so
			- Fall 2025: New version of scs-0102 with mandatory `os_vanilla` (and naming is already only a recommendation here) and new version for [scs-0104](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0102-v1-image-metadata#technical-requirements-and-features) which defines standard images not by name.
		- (JSc) Could define `os_purpose=generic`, opening us a future hatch for expansion.
		    - Could be useful for images including GPU drivers for instance.
- AI @garloff: Make PR for scs-0102

#### OpenStack powered Compute discussion
- Public Cloud SIG mourns the demise
- The idea is still valid
	- Though OpenStack powered compute was never enough to really achieve high levels of Interoperability
	- Silver member requirement $25k/a was a hurdle
