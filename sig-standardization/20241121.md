#### Stabilizing SCS-compatible KaaS v1 (for real this time)

sponsor: @mbuechse/@garloff

- current state of affairs
  - kaas check scripts now include a plugin system for provisioning and unprovisioning clusters necessary for tests
    - however, no plugin for Gardener yet, and plugin for ClusterStacks (moin) is only almost finished
    - we have plugin "kind" for dev purposes and "static kubeconfig" (so no provisioning and unprovisioning) for long-running clusters
  - main SCS check script can now run Sonobuoy, incl. test for KaaS networking (see PR [standards#832](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/832)) :rocket:
  - KaaS networking [stabilization PR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/833): Merged
  - version policy: improved cve check (with trivy) WIP, but not critical (can still be improved after stabilization)
  - ToDo: node distribution ([scs-0214-v2](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0214-v2-k8s-node-distribution)): remove reference to check script for the time being, as we don't have the `host-id` label, so it's inconclusive
- Decision: Do scs-0214-v2 changes as described by the end of the week and then stabilize KaaS-v1 next week.

#### JFYI: UNICC likely to adopt SCS standards (@garloff)
