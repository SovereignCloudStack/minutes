### Agenda today

* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/pull/9
  * Standard images with standard names helps IaaS users (DevOps teams)
  * Keep mandatory list small ... only Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS (or CentOS successor?), in this order
    * Trouble is that there is some uncertainty with CentOS currently
  * Could differentiate b/w mandatory, recommended, optional
    * Cirros trouble: standard default password
    * Mandatory images must NOT have a default password, must not allow REMOTE (ssh) password auth
  * Mandatory: (aligned in this group)
    * Two most recent Ubuntu LTS versions (moving on when .1 is released)
    * Debian STABLE
  * Recommended: (needs more discussion)
    * CentOS / CentOS successor (Alma? Rocky?) -> should be moved to Mandatory as soon as future is clear
    * SLES (latest SAP certified version....)
    * RHEL (trouble: public image availability)
    * Debian old STABLE
    * Fedora
  * Optional: (needs more discussion)
    * Alpine
    * Arch
    * Cirros
    * grml
    * openSUSE Leap
    * CoreOS
  => Needs broader discussion, ask cloud providers
  - Goal: Enable 90+% of user workloads without them requiring to download and register and renew their images. Image should be at least minimally tested (login with injected ssh key works).
  - Separate discussion: Which images support special managed services or have support service offereings from providers
  - https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/obtain-images.html
  - ImageManager should provide configs for Mandatory and Recommended at least ...

* Finalize discussion around freshness of images (cf. https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/blob/main/Design-Docs/Image-Properties-Spec.md#image-updating)
  * Should recommend monthly updates (at least), keep old images
  * Feature request to ImageManager to monitor freshness and rotate old images ...
