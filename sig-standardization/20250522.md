### Housekeeping

#### Check AIs from last time

- @mbuechse: write to scs-tech list regarding relaxation of entropy-related regulation
  - DONE on 2025-05-20 at 16:21; subject `[request for veto] relax entropy standard`, deadline *June 6*
  - so far, response was to keep checks for extra certainty, but demote rng-related stuff to recommendation (where it isn't already)
- @mbuechse: introduce ability to tidy up test code
  - created issue [standards#921](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/921)
  - PR [standards#928](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/928) -- has been merged

### Agenda

#### Image names revisited

sponsor: @mbuechse

- standard images standard requires an image named "Ubuntu 24.04"
  - it specifies permissible source URLs, specifically
    - <https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/noble/>
    - <https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/noble/>
  - however, it doesn't specify instruction set architecture (ISA)
    - so we could use <https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/noble/release-20250516/ubuntu-24.04-server-cloudimg-s390x.img>
    - What does 's390x' even mean?
      - I'm just now learning from Wikipedia: "The *IBM System/390* is a discontinued mainframe product â€¦" and "*IBM Enterprise Systems Architecture* is an instruction set architecture introduced by IBM as Enterprise Systems Architecture/370 (ESA/370) in 1988."
  - so this standard seems a bit weak
- original proposal:
  - drop this image requirement from next version of SCS-compatible IaaS, no longer enforce it for v3, v4, v5.1
  - if necessary, find a suitable replacement for this image requirement (at least mention ISA)
  - avoid any contrived naming scheme, try to abandon a fixed name altogether!
- discussion
  - we could say that amd64 is default if nothing else is specified
  - there can be multiple images with the same name
  - OpenStack will find the one with the right architecture (`architecture` is a standard OpenStack property for images)
  - fixed name does mean extra convenience in some places
  - would be nice if Glance had real alias support
    - Glance does have reasonable filtering
    - we could use `os_distro` and `os_version`
    - however, some derivatives/non-stock images could use these properties as well
    - we could use a property `scs_name` to keep the alias
    - or add a property `os_stock`, `os_original` or `os_upstream`, (boolean) which would avoid fixing some name
- decision:
  - use `os_distro`, `os_version` AND (new) `os_original`
  	- ToDo: Double check the [recommended](https://docs.openstack.org/glance/latest/user/common-image-properties.html) `os_distro` names for capitalization
  - make sure that it works this way, write blogpost, documenting best practices to identify the right image using opentofu, ansible, SDK, ...
  - then make it mandatory!!!

#### Open issues and pull requests

sponsor: @mbuechse

- default storage class, [scs-0211](https://docs.scs.community/standards/kaas/scs-0211)
  - problems with check script for v1
    - issue [standards#662](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issue/662)
    - PR [standards#745](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/745)
  - apparently, no check script for v2 as yet
  - the PR for v1 is in bad shape
    - it changes files that are totally unrelated (likely just a mistake)
    - it's gotten a bit old and needs to be rebased
    - at first glance the code seems unnecessarily long and complicated
    - I'm not sure I understand why certain things are tested
  - if v2 is what we want, maybe put effort into testing that
    - maybe assess what's good in the PR and should therefore be salvaged
    - apart from that, close it
  - discussion:
    - topic is important, e.g., for platform services
    - go for v2 of the standard
    - response from experts was that it is not too hard to implement
  - decision:
    - focus on scs-0211-v2, abandon v1
    - improve language, write test script, potentially salvaging what's good from PR [standards#745](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/745), then stabilize
