#### New certification diagram 

![picture of new diagram](https://input.scs.community/uploads/39cdf735-1f94-4509-a6fd-7f871bf36df3.png)

- try to use only one line for each layer; certification versions may overlap, but use colors/hatching to represent that

#### Versioning / stabilized_at 
- Version validity and governance is not sufficiently described 
- AI (@mbuechse): make a draft proposal for the rolling versioning process including governance question. Concretely, when will a new version be issued and is this date to be set. 
--> To be discussed, when Kurt is back 

#### Visualizing standards processes
- Table: First column: single standard (plus single realizations (versions) of a standard), subsequent columns versions: In each cell stating whether part of cert version or not.
- --> AD to make a first draft.
- Alternatively, one row per standard and stating the standard version.
