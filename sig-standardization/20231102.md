### Housekeeping

#### Designate people to transfer minutes and report in community call

- @garloff

#### Check AIs from last time

- _AI @mbuechse: extend scs-0003_ to accommodate for classification of tests (light, medium, heavy) with respect to resource usage
    - DONE, cf. merged PR [standards/#365](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/365)
- _AI: @fkr will organize a preparation meeting to prioritize issues in [epic standards/#285](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/285)_
    - still OPEN
- _AI (not officially): add proposals to [standards/#359](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/359)_ regarding potential frameworks (such as unittest @fdobrovolny) and a little preview of what our use case would look like
    - done
    - Goal: Discuss this some more, take a decision by 2023-11-16

### Agenda

#### SCS test environment at C&H (Anja)

(this is a spillover topic from last meeting)

- Scope:
    - Provide additional SCS cluster for testing purposes
    - Use cluster to learn how to move from provider-specific configuration to SCS standards and summarize these experiences in How-To guides as part of SCS documentation
    - Provide scripts to make existing cloud environment SCS compliant
- Process:
    - Start with normal C&H setup
    - Change setup standard by standard
    - write blog article with experiences
- Questions:
    - Do any how-to guides already exist?
        - No, though there are some tools (openstack-image-manager, flavor-manager, and of course the compliance checks)
    - _AI @anjastrunk: Create issues (one epic issue and separate issues for each standard)_
        - Blog articles wanted :-)

#### Bugs in the extensions scheme of the flavor naming standard (Anja)

- the extensions scheme used brackets unevenly, so the syntax was not clear
    - in particular, whether CPU generation could be used without vendor
- the script was a good guideline for finding the correct way to bracket
- brackets have been corrected and, for the sake better clarity, the syntax repeated for each type of extension
- please review [PR standards/#364](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/364)
    - _AI @mbuechse: Add one sentence that mentions that CPU generation can only be used together with the CPU vendor/architecture._
    - Ready to merge then.

#### Possible Inconsistency between Image Metadata and Server Flavor  (Anja)

- Image metadata requires CPU architecture, with range as defined in [libosinfo project](https://docs.openstack.org/glance/latest//admin/useful-image-properties)
- Server Flavor allows to define CPU archtecure, with range {`i` Intel x86-64, `z` AMD x86-64, `a` AArch64, `r` RISC-V}
- Ranges do not match, is this intended?
    - Different scope
    - _AI @mbuechse: Add explanation that server flavors with `i` and `z` should support images built for `x86_64`, `a` for `aarch64` and `r` is not yet listed for images in OpenStack)_

#### Template for Standard User Story (Anja)

- Are all bullet points really neccessary?
- In the past, issues have been closed as resolved with most points still open
    - Definition of Ready:
        - User Story is small enough to be finished within one sprint - this is often not the case, has user story requires several PRs
        - User Story is clear and understood by the whole team
        - Acceptance criteria are defined - ??
        - Acceptance criteria are clear and understood by the whole team - how do we document this?
    - Definition of Done:
        - All acceptance criteria are met
        - Changes have been reviewed  - Merge is blocked, if there is not review or approval
        - CI tests have run successfully - If CI tests fail, PR is not able to merge
        - Documentation has been updated - ???
        - Release Notes have been updated - ???
- The template creates a lot of questions:
   - Where should Documentation and RelNotes go to?
   - Can I just delete parts of the criteria
- idea: add links (to where the docs/release notes go, to some detailed process documentation), add comments (that are not rendered)
- More refinement need to create higher quality user stories
- issue [issues/#332](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/332) is a start at a process description
    - e.g. labels in github
    - end result should be on the docs pages
    - _AI @mbuechse and @fdobrovolny: move this forward_

#### Processes for initial certification and continued compliance tracking

- [PR standards/#356](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/356) still open for review
- currently open questions
    - change SHOULD into MUST: "Manual checks SHOULD be repeated once every 3 months."
        - Let's do it!
    - drop Zuul nodepools altogether? (wouldn't they be desirable?)
        - to be discussed next time
    - should we demand visibility from the CSP?
        - could be a MUST for public clouds and a SHOULD for private clouds
        - we (SCS) have the right to display it

#### Progress regarding documentation

- [PR 76](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/76) merged
    - have a look at the [docs page](https://docs.scs.community/standards)
- next step: [Automate creation of standards overview pages](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/issues/97)
