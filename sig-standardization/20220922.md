### Agenda today

#### Image Standard

@frosty-geek: "Nobody has tried the standard, before defining it". 
When should the new "Standard" become active?
-> Suggestion define that on every Release implicitly all new Versions of Standards will become active and will be announced in the Release Notes.
-> Timeframe for the CSPs to comply would be allinged with the timeframe we give the CSPs to update their environments
=> this should be documented in the release policies:  
https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/blob/main/Design-Docs/Release-Policies.md
To make this possible we should release Draft Versions as early as possible and have a working Proof of Concept & Conformance Tests for them.
If something is in the Draft Status while releasing we should list the current Drafts in the release notes.
@fkr: "nothing should go from Draft to Standard if there is no Conformance Tests for it" Document this in the Release Policies aswell
Draft -> Confirmence Tests -> Document approved

We also need a central Place listing the current Standards a CSP has to follow
@matfechner: "Idea: have something similar to RFC's that can be obsolated by etc."

@alexander-diab will open Issues to fix the documentation


#### SCS Container Standard to require  Local Storage from IaaS layer

@matfechner: "Idea: we should suggest local storage from CSPs because of problems withing the SCS CaaS Layer" -> Ephmeral Storage
This would require specific compute flavors and hardware setups, which we currently don't do
@frosty-geek: I would recommend this to be a blueprint from a CSP who has already implemented it
-> Team CaaS should try to figure out what performance indicator (i/o, latency) are needed for the workload

@matfechner will open an Issue for Team CaaS
