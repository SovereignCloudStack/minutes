#### SCS-0001: Fix "status" field description
PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/185
Current stable document: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0001-v1-sovereign-cloud-standards.md
* @itrich to contact @horazont about how to proceed. Either amending the document and bumping the version or working with a minor modification.
* Add mermaid graph to the documentation.

#### Directory structure of standards repo
* See [PR #193] (https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/193)
	* Good?
	* Can we always clearly differentiate between ADRs and Standards? Should they be merged?
		* @itrich proposed to declare every document that is contained in a certification YAML as a standard, otherwise as a decision.
	* @itrich to have a look at the PR
	* Open questions: capitalized directory names?

#### Flavor naming
Informational: We have a problem with our flavor naming spec, see standards issue #190, #192
* Investigate first, whether there are workarounds within OpenShift possible, e.g. quoting the flavor name

#### Review backlog
* We need to make progress, please review standards PRs #182 (+#187), #183, #185, #186/#177, #191

We need to follow this order:
* #183 first
* then #177 into main
* #187 into #182
* #182 into main
