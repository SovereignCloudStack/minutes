### Agenda

#### Concept for certification website

sponsor: @selis-osba

- @selis-osba presents her sketches
- discussion of target groups
  - who: user/provider
  - what: cloud/integration services
- prominent linking to official standards and scopes
- sub page per provider? (is there a lot of information beyond achieving the scope SCS-XaaS-vY which we show in the list -- compliance monitor? -> later)

#### Secure Connections Standard scs-0125

sponsor: @mbuechse

- see https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0125-v1-secure-connections
- currently draft
- postponed to the next meeting for lack of time

#### Record aborted testcases

sponsor: @mbuechse

- see https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/975/files
- FYI: intention to replace a whole battery of test scripts by a single test script per layer (one for OpenStack, one for Kubernetes) with a simple, uniform command-line syntax (just list the testcase ids you want to see tested)
- apparently, no veto from group: just keep developer documentation in mind

#### SCS-compatible KaaS provisioning API

sponsor: @mbuechse

- two distinct areas of standardization
  - what do the clusters look like
  - cluster management (create, scale, upgrade, destroy etc.)
- so far, we focused on the former
- the latter could be viewed as a third "layer": KaaS management
- seems important to get rid of vendor lock-in
- (to be continued)
