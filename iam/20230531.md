## Agenda

### Sprint review Copenhagen, sprint planning Dublin
Taskboard: https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/27

#### Epic [#191](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/191): CLI/Web login via fed. ID
* [#261](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/261) - DevAuthGrant upstream: Done? Yes
* [#293](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/293): Auth code flow with PKCE
* What's next? https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/293#issuecomment-1557396841
    * Waiting for upstream feedback, @reqa to raise awareness in next IRC meeting
    * Downstream patch is not really helpful for production (as we don't get it into all customers' hands easily)
    * PKCE doc reading: May do another change to a setting (plain -> s256), PR against testbed, issue TBD (@reqa)

#### Epic [#25](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/25) - Fed. auth (SCS consumers)
* [#194](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/194) - Requirements IdP Broker
    * Related to [#267](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/267)
    * Implementation work [issues/#307](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/307) - waiting for Jan's return
* [#254](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/254) - ADR IdP features: Done?
    * PR [standards/#270](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/270), completed
        * Need to stabilize it (@reqa)
* What's next? [#182](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/182): Document SSL cert import (@JuanPTM)

#### [#314](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/314): Reconfiguring keystone federation
* No response from upstream (Kristi) yet
* SIG discussion: Can we ignore this for a moment? Work around ...
    * Separate login page? (`wsgi-keystone.conf`: `OIDCDiscoverURL` in [mod_auth_openidc docs](https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/blob/ee43adf82d8c2c788dd0f93e30efa369c0c99647/auth_openidc.conf#L709))
    * Have email addresses (with domain name serving as domain/realm selector) as username?
    * Combine either of those two options with a proxy realm in keycloak to avoid the apache restart issue
        * keystone -> keycloak proxy realm -> keycloak customer realm
        * claims in keystone are then from proxy realm, would be valid for all customers, rules.json needed to map realms ... in order to issue a (domain-scoped) token that authorizes for the correct domain

#### TODO: Document different admin roles ... CSP admin, Domain admin, IAM admin, Project admin and who has responsibility for what 
* @garloff, @reqa: Create issue, and write down what we already agreed on OR (if we find we have not sufficiently aligned yet) create alignment in workshop

#### [#317](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/317): Onboarding: Group, role, project creation best practices (from PS)
* Needs review (@reqa, @garloff)
