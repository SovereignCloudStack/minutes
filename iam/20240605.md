- TODO: Overall documentation how we do Security Scanning in SCS should be added to [docs.scs.community](https://docs.scs.community/) - starting point: https://docs.scs.community/docs/operating-scs/components/automated-pentesting/overview/

### Quick update regarding Role Standard (@markus-hentsch)

PR: [#590](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/590)

- @josephineSei noticed that components like Nova *do* override the oslo.policy defaults with their own defaults and already use enforce_new_defaults after all (https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/7dc4b1ea627d864a0ee2745cc9de4336fc0ba7b5/nova/policy.py#L44-L52)
    - standard needs to be updated accordingly as it currently assumes this isn't the case
- difficult situation considering all the limitations resulting from the WIP upstream RBAC rework and conflicting component configuration
    - new policy defaults incompatible with Heat (requires validation, some upstream fixes have been merged but is still being discussed in the Keystone IRC)
    - some components already use new defaults, making behavior non-uniform
- current SCS downstream implementation of Domain Manager is limited to adjusting `policy.yaml` and cannot touch Keystone source code; as such it is mutually exclusive to the enforce_new_defaults/enforce_scope options and those need to be kept disabled in Keystone for now
    - this will be solved once Domain Manager is integrated upstream which will include the necessary code adjustments
    - for now, add note to the SCS Domain Manager Standard: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/585 - reviews are desired
