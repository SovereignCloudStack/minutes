### Domain Manager Standard (@markus-hentsch)
~ 5 Minutes

Standard: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0302-v1-domain-manager-role.md
PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/384

Open docs PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/178
    - states limitations regarding Domain Manager vs. Identity Federation

- standard is still in draft state
- Q: who is able to test the policy configuration and verification script on a current testbed so that we can get it out of draft state? anything else required to get it out of draft state besides testing?
- A: We can test in testbeds and CiaB setup, it's included in OSISM :-)
- A: Let's reuse the keycloak-enabled test setups from Univention
- Open question: Once you delegate your IDM to an external IdP, can you still create projects (which the *local* domain manager role does allow)?
- Stabilizing: Submit PR with s/Draft/Stabilized_on: YYYY-MM-DD/
    - Ideally we can wait for upstream to minimize our risk of divergence
