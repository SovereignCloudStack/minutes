## Housekeeping

* Minutes taking & transfer: @gtema
* Reporting in Comm Call: @garloff
* Cancel next week's meeting due to EOF

### Taxonomy of Failsafe Levels (@josephineSei)

- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/579
- @martinmo and I restructured this DR
- we would like to see people check for sanity
- KaaS parts are still partly missing (will go to container team meeting and
  ask for input there)
- PLEASE REVIEW!
- TODO:
    - Add views from the security perspective
    - Add views from the container perspective

### EOF preparation (@garloff)
* IAM: @garloff/@gtema
    * Use hedgedoc slides: <https://input.scs.community/scs-eof-iam#>
* Sec: @bitkeks
    * Same slide deck

### Documentation (@garloff)
* All documentation should be accessible via https://docs.scs.community/
    * IAM: 
        * Documented, but ...
        * Additional open questions, e.g. on day 2 Ops, complexity of certain
          things, e.g. adding a domain (-> additional automation needed)
        * Limitations that are found (redeploy keystone for new domains?)
        * 1:1 relationship keycloak realm <-> keystone domain needs keystone
          restart
            * will be fixed in Dalmatian (API interface)
            * Also in Dalmatian: some mod_auth_oidc changes no longer required
        * Announce upstream federation improvements, @gtema, @JuanPTM
    * Roles ... ?:
        * Upstream (some pieces in Dalmatian -- feature freeze this Friday)
            * Spec was merged, implementation done, merging still WIP
            * -> Release Notes ('till morning of 2024-09-04), @markus-hentsch,
              @gtema
    * Sec Scan Pipeline:
        * all done for IaaS, see
          https://docs.scs.community/docs/operating-scs/components/automated-pentesting/overview
        * todo: KaaS with trivy, trivy-operator (AI: @specterj)
            * WIP in branch:
              https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-k8s-scan-pipeline/pull/1
* Link it from "turnkey solution" overview
    * Deployment guides (where, when, how, why?) @garloff

### IAM workshop (@garloff)
* Preparation: https://input.scs.community/Workshop-IAM-20240830#

### Security (@90n20 & @spectertj)
* Infra Scan pipeline: PlusServer has authorized to scan their IP ranges. Minor
  changes on configuration are needed to adjust to it.
    * Due to the increase on the number of targets, default timeouts for base
      scan jobs (1 hour) have to be increased. We have observed termination of
test jobs due to this.
        * Nodes with more CPU power might also help with run time (dedicated
          nodeset with more powerful flavors exists -- Node Label
`ubuntu-jammy-large` with 4vCPUs instead of two), especially for Greenbone
* Blog post draft for security pipeline tools. Initial content has been added:
  [PR #994](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/pull/994)
    * Feedback wanted and more ideas ...
    * Planned publication this week
* K8s scan: The cronjob has been created to be able to manage and upload the
  reports generated by the Trivy Operator, these reports will go in a bucket in
  object storage (OpenStack). For it two scripts have been created, one to obtain
  the reports and the other to be able to upload them to OpenStack
  https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/669
    * PR to be created (AI @specterj)
    * Documentation needs updating to reflect this (AI @specterj)
