    * IAM design doc, [#397](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/397): [Docs PR#72](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/72)
    * Blog post OpenStack CLI & Dev Authz Grant PKCE: [website PR #728](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/pull/728)

### R5
* SCS R5 is released today, yeah!

### Kyoto review / Ljubljana planning
* [Taskboard](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/27)
    * Merged: moving features from testbed to release repos [#412](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/412)
        * Settings copied from testbed to osism/cookiecutter, osism/defaults and osism/ansible-playbooks
    * Open: document how to activate OIDC federation: Asked cberendt via matrix
        * ToDo: Document how to enable federation (AI @reqa: create issue) -> https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/422
        * ToDo: Document how config settings are handled in OSISM ("a->b->c approach") -- also ensure that things can be tested or better are covered by testing (CI / individual / ...) (AI @garloff: ensure this is tracked)
    * Federated login: added upstream patch to test if users can be set on different domains instead of default one. [#405](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/405) [Keystone patch](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone/+/739966) from [this keystone-spec initiative](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone-specs/+/748042)
        * Patch does probably more than it needs to do (blueprint `versioning-for-attribute-mapping-schema`)
        * Testing was unsuccessful -- user was still created in wrong domain (keycloak federation domain)
        * Users in wrong domains may be confusing but don't seem to have negative security implications (with default policies)

### Issues found in pentesting
* Nothing in https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/security/advisories ?
* Today we will test the Security Advisories with a low severity vulns to check that everything is fine before we document everything
    * Tags not available -- but we can use severity ratings
* We have tested some DoS asociated to CVE's that we have found and we get them "work" so we can make the infrastructure "Hang"
* We have a list of findings of more than 5 pages, as soon as we test the Security Advisories functionality and everythings work's fine we will "upload" that info.
* We are also checking one by one every finding to ensure that its not a false positive and also making fuzzing procces to try to get some not known vulns over the services
    * Summary reports for negatives and false positives to avoid administrative overhead
    * In case of doubt, we track findings via sec advisories
* Checking exposed services one-byone
    * tedious
