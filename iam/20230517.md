### Progress [review](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/27)
* k8s integration [issues/#307](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/307)
    * old (1 year) instructions no longer working ...
    * having access to a working keycloak instance would help with testing
    * sshuttle access to IAM team's testbed FTW
    * https://docs.scs.community/docs/testbed/doc/usage
* keystone device auth grant flow ~~[#261](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/261)~~, [#293](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/293)
    * change PKCE to not use implicit grant
        * requires support for PKCE with device authentication
        * testbed is configured to use PKCE flow
    * worked with @jnull to find best solution
    * special modificated openstack cli is available but doesn't feel very stable and insecure
* Eval UCS vs keystone for local users [issues/#315](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/315)
    * Too much overhead currently compared to the advantages
    * Thus no LDAP (even though wavecon needs it for database auth)
        * Medium-term: We need to teach databases to support federation
* IdP cert import into keycloak for IdP federation: Self-Service capability? 
    * currently no work on it
    * federation between 2 scs clouds
        * need to be described
        * document this first and get a feeling how to build tooling around it
    * create user story for this, so we can tackle it in Dublin (related to #182 and #189?)
* Container restart avoidance work [#314](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/314)
    * Contacted OpenStack Keystone team member Kristi Nikolla to collect upstream opinion/plans
    * Config files are not reread automatically
    * ask upstream how they think that should work to avoid apache restart
* Horizon usability with many realms
    * Avoid disclosing list of realms/IdPs
    * User <-> realm relationship needs to be established
    * Create issue to tackle in Dublin
* PS domain, groups, users recommendation [#317](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/317)
    * @JuanPTM wrote down first Draft in [PR #284](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/284), @reqa and @garloff to review it
* [#254](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/254) in discussion ([standards/#269](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/269)) with @joshmue in requirements, PR [standards/#270](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/270), can likely be completed today
