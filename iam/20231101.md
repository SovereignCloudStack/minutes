## Agenda

### Roles, domain manager role

* domain manager concept was presented to upstream in the OpenDev Keystone vPTG on 2023-10-25
    * two possible contributions were proposed:
            1) the domain manager role concept as a whole [#384](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/384)
            2) an adjustment to the "GET /v3/domains" endpoint to prevent the full list of domains being returned with domain-scoped token [#446](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/446)
    * regarding no. 1 upstream was pretty welcoming towards the idea and requested @markus-hentsch to write a spec for it
    * upstream considered no. 2 to be a genuine bug and requested a Launchpad bug to be filed before contributing a patch, which @markus-hentsch did:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/2041611
        * the patch for this as drafted in [#446](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/446#issuecomment-1775337500) needs more work before it can be upstreamed as it can be circumvented via project scope currently, @markus-hentsch needs to dig deeper into Keystone's implementation and fix this
