## Agenda

### Today is R6 day
* [Release Notes](https://docs.scs.community/docs/releases/Release6)
    * Referencing blog articles is a good idea!
* [Press release](https://scs.community/release/2024/03/20/release6/) 
    

### Retro & R7 goals
* Classical retro: How do we work, interact, ...
* What should we: Start doing, Continue doing, Stop Doing?
    * Scrumlr https://scrumlr.io/board/f2b8eb90-2814-4fc5-b82e-00939d6d91a8
    * Stop 🫨: 
        * Too much repetition - skip already discussed topics
    * Continue 👍:
        * Team strong, good vibes, good workflow
        * Topic of domain manager role took a lot of iterations, but it's a good feature we should continue to bring the changes into upstream
        * More documentation of pentesting pipeline tools (available configs, what DefectDojo does etc.)
        * Working with upstream on dynamic mapping of roles with OpenStack/Cleura also proved very productive
        * Special breakout sessions for topics that need longer discussions worked well
    * Start 🚀:
        * Preparing linked documents earlier is helpful - given that they are posted in the minutes before the meeting starts..
        * Follow up on notifications in Zuul, that will come out of the security pipeline
            * More short-term goals, e.g. need concrete patches or new documentation that can be finished in one week. Fly closer to daily work instead of highest-level visions
        * Create ability to manage identities and auth for k8s clusters with Keycloak
        * Write/have tests for federated login that can be executed to verify that things don't break, e.g. for a new Keycloak release
        * Documentation for operators regarding onboarding of new customer realms/domains
        * Sync topics with IaaS more frequently (check IaaS agenda routinely)
* AIs 🤖:
    * Security: lightning talk about security assessment and upcoming pentesting pipeline
    * Kurt: Find slot for meeting prep with Josephine/Markus
    * all: Breakout sessions should document decisions and bring results back into the weeklies
    * Kurt: Send agenda for IAM meeting out earlier (setting an earlier deadline for the agenda)
    * all: Regularly check the IaaS agenda against ours
    * Arvid: Create tests for federated login (e.g. Keycloak). Offer tests as drafts/examples
* What did we plan, what did we achieve, what did we not, why?
* Big picture
* Release Notes driven Development
* Release Goals / Outcomes -> What does it mean for each of us?
