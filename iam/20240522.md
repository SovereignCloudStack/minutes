## Topics

### Role Standard (@markus-hentsch)

Issue: [issues#396](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/396)

PR: [standards#590](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/590)

(topic also discussed in today's IaaS call, copied here)

- after defining mandatory/supported services in [issues#528](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/528), now revisited this task based on the resulting list of components
    - created new PR from scratch, incorporating all research results: [standards#590](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/590)
    - lots and lots of research, complex situation with the state of the upstream RBAC rework
    - in short: `enforce_scope` and `enforce_new_defaults` would modernize and streamline roles but break compatibility with orchestration like Heat and cause other issues
        - options not default in upstream yet, [upstream is aware of issues and postponed it](https://governance.openstack.org/tc/goals/selected/consistent-and-secure-rbac.html#the-issues-we-are-facing-with-scope-concept)
        - SCS wants Heat as supported service -> conflict
            - also other orchestration tooling might have problems (Magnum maybe?)
        - options also contradict the SCS' Domain Manager policy-only downstream implementation (limited to Keystone) until Domain Manager is integrated upstream
        - service-specific roles for Barbican and Octavia still necessary without these options
- Q: role for testing
    - test script needs "list_roles" permission in Keystone (admin-only per default), how to address?
        - a) give combined admin+member account = let CSP operator execute it
        - b) introduce "scs-conformance-tester" role and add "list_roles" permission to it = external tests possible
            - this could serve as the base for more tests in the future requiring more than member
            - this role would only be assigned to the technical user for Zuul
        - c) (added by Kurt) re-use the manager role, which already has this permission
- A: in the IaaS community call, option a was favored
    - Kurt is in favor of option c

### Domain manager persona
- Q: Feedback / Aftermath from OpenInfraDay
    - Network sharing wanted (Frank Gemein @ scaleUp) for domain manager persona
        - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/384#issuecomment-2114871313
            - neutron has no concept of domains, would probably require architectural change
        - Divert to neutron network policies?
        - Consensus: Keep network sharing out out domain manager persona, let's keep things simple

### IAM topics (@JuanPTM)

- Issue: [issues#596](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/596)
    - Finally working
        - Added a script to the Keycloak container that generates the files needed for the example setup configuration
    - Multiple MR ([osism/ansible-playbooks](https://github.com/osism/ansible-playbooks/pull/403), [scs/container-images](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/container-images/pull/8), [scs/docs](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/190))
    - Docs are still not clear where to place them
        - Asked @maxwolfs
        - AI @garloff: Followup with @maxwolfs and @JuanPTM

- Issue: [issues#595](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/595)
    - Changes to the README on `container-images` explaining how to create a new image
    - [MR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/container-images/pull/9)
        - Reviews or ideas ?

### Security (@90n20)

- Security pipeline
    - Last 2 pipeline runs on SCS Zuul have been failed due to docker timeout errors: "*Error connecting: Error while fetching server API version: Not supported URL scheme http+docker*". Apparently it is related to changes as reported in [Breaks with requests 2.32.0: Not supported URL scheme http+docker](https://github.com/docker/docker-py/issues/3256). We are looking on how to fix this.
        - Only solution is to pin requests < 2.32.0 at the moment, PR in docker-py is pending: https://github.com/docker/docker-py/pull/3257
    - Minor fixes performed on the repo related to variables naming: [fix/variables-naming](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/pull/4)
    - [Issue #537](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/537): Almost all Greenbone CE blockers for the weekly trigger have been solved. The python script developed to configure, manage and trigger the scans is working, generating a xml report as a result of the scan.
        - Scan configuration: "full and fast". Uses almost all available Vulnerability Tests obtained from feeds and it is optimized to have a low false negative rate.
            - Ports: "All TCP and Nmap top 100 UDP"
        - Blockers: Besides scans are being performed, the xml report is not being imported to DefectDojo. We are debugging why this is happening to try to solve it.

- Container layer - Antonio (@Spectertj) has been working on containerizing Trivy (trivy-operator) in order to trigger automated scans through a pipeline. We are testing this implementation with a CaaS layer in our demonstrator space.

### Barbican Plugin Standard (@josephineSei, ~15 min)

- Issue: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/509
- Problem: many CSPs don't use a key-manager at all.
    - What would be better:
        - having more CSPs providing a key-manager and thus the possibility to encrypt user data
        - requiring a higher level of security than storing a masterKEK in a plaintext config file
- The workflows:
1.  Right now in many deployments the user data lays around unencrypted. An attack would simply target the storage of a deployment.
2. If using Barbican with the simple crypto plugin, the user data can be encrypted. An attacker would need access to the storage and either to the network, sniffing the key (that should be prevent by the secure communication standard) or to the Barbican config (to get the masterkek) and the Barbican database.   We should acknowledge that this is an improvement compared to the first option.
3. If using Barbican with any other plugin, it is way harder to get access to the masterKEK. This would be an improvement of the second option.

Decision: CSPs SHOULD implement the key-manager API (as implemented by barbican) with a security level of at least Option 2 (for example simple-crypto as used in barbican), better would be Option 3 (where the master key is not stored in plain on the barbican node)
