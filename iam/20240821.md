## Housekeeping

* Reporting in Comm Call: @JuanPTM

## Agenda

### IAM (@JuanPTM)

* Filter users from social login [#711](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/711)
    * Different options, more common is at the app level
    * Other approachs: Plugins, custom autheticators, etc...
    * Challenge: Doing control *only* at the application (SP) level always leaves access to keycloak and may also not be well implemented in all apps
    * Additional filtering at keycloak level desirable -- AI @garloff: sent intro mail to Alex Schwartz with @JuanPTM, @gtema

### Turnkey Solution / Documentation (@garloff)
* We do not have an integrated installation process that deploys all SCS tools
* Turnkey v1: Ensure we have instructions for operators how to install all useful SCS pieces
    * Requires all modules to be documented and have installation instructions (and considerations)
    * All docs should be on <https://docs.scs.community/> !
        * Reach out if you don't know how to be picked up by our Docusaurus!
    * Will create overview table
* Turnkey v2: Continue with more integration ... 
* zuul: Our SCS instance is not part of the release
* zuul for Operators should be documented as part of the release
    * This is the where they do their CI and their security scanning
    * zuul is a requirement for implementing their own security pipeline by operators *if* they want to use our reference implementation
