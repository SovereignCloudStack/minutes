* Reporting in Community Call Thu 15:05: @JuanPTM

## Agenda

### Avisory [CVE-2024-40767](https://scs.community/security/2024/07/23/cve-2024-40767/)
* Was a coordinated release (2024-07-23 15:00 UTC)
* This time hard to exploit (unlike CVE-2024-32498)
* Upstream fix available, only affecting nova-compute container
* Public SCS clouds all patched on 2024-07-23 prior to disclosure

### Security scanning
* Two weeks of vacation @90n20
* @spectertj will keep working on Caas layer scanning
    * Working on integrate reports uploading to S3 buckets to preserve the data. As discussed with @bitkeks we should determine which reports should be "saved". With a central repository like defectdojo (which integrates reports partial storage and deduplication) it makes no sense to store every day scans results, especially taking into account that traceability for compliance with third parties usually requires yearly scans.
* WIP: Documentation of both IaaS and CaaS repositories
* zuul trouble from last week
    * Single-instance zookeeper cleanup not working well, overflows
    * Node failures due to FIPs not being released (-> out of FIP quota in gxscs)
    * new zuul setup underway (@gtema) on k8s

### Keycloak
- Import CA into Keycloak [issue#597](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/597)
    - Documented on the [PR Ansible-collection](https://github.com/osism/ansible-collection-services/pull/1480) how to deploy it
- Feedback from @gtema, @scoopex: We lack good automation for setting up keycloak and the big picture
    - declarative configurability leaves to be desired
    - configuration and operations model needs to documented
        - keycloak can be screwed up too easily
- Big picture needs to clarified as well
    - @JuanPTM with support from @reqate to dig up material and discuss with @gtema
    - @garloff to pick up again in 3 weeks
- Incremental improvements
    - Be pragmatic (for R7)
- Need to rediscuss the IAM architecture for R8

### Federation
- Upstream work proceeding
- Need to align our keycloak work with upstream development

### Roles
- Upstream change for enabling SRBAC (enforce_scope) centrally in oslo in review
- Goal for R8 as well (via 2024.2)
- Domain manager
     - domain manager tests in tempest being worked on (@markus-hentsch)
    - one update (not considered in the downstream SCS implementation yet): keystone has domain-specific roles
        - upstream: domain manager can only do reader and member and manager assignments (to avoid privilege escalation)
            - domain-specific roles would be always be named differently (since global reader, member, manager roles already exist)
        - domain-specific role management does not make sense for the domain manager: they cannot assign/revoke them (due to the limitation to eligible roles) and also cannot change policy definitions from outside, hence not being able to make them have any effect
        - SCS downstream domain manager did not support the capability before either to manage domain-specific roles
            - do not add support for them, does not make sense for customers
