## Agenda

### Invitation to fill-in the community survey (@nadjaschreiber by Thu evening)
- https://scs.sovereignit.de/nextcloud/apps/forms/s/mctSbfEYEmadiJnfrLig8oir

### Security updates (@bitkeks and @spectertj)

- Infos related to OpenStack qcow2 incident CVE-2024-32498 in IaaS call
    - Security advisory published at [CVE-2024-32498](https://scs.community/de/security/2024/07/02/cve-2024-32498/) aka [OSSA-2024-001](https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2024-001.html)
        - If you are aware of anyone who may be affected but has not received this, please forward ...
- Works on scanner pipelines and Trivy cluster scanner continue as discussed
    - See [issues/669](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/669#issuecomment-2196213322)
    - Running the Trivy operator (or similar operators) store their reports in the cluster, with a storage time limit. Export of reports must be looked into closely to ensure archivability (and access for people)
        - SCS object storage (s3) considered
- New ideas and inputs from KCD Munich, in review
    - TBD

### Key Manager Standard (@josephineSei)
- PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/599
- just asking for reviews

### Role Standard (@markus-hentsch)

Issue: [issues#396](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/396)
Standard PR: [#590](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/590)

- new findings in the issue regarding Secure RBAC (`enforce_scope`/`enforce_new_defaults`)
    - adoption rate (see [this comment](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/396#issuecomment-2197463142)) based on most common services classified as either mandatory or supported in SCS (status of current in-dev 2024.2):
        - about 50% of the services default to the new options already
        - about 25% support them but still use old defaults
        - the remaining 25% do not seem to support the options
    - compatibility with Heat and roadmap (see [this comment](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/396#issuecomment-2200097660))
        - issues with Heat seem to be solved
        - 2024.2 wants to make new Secure RBAC options enabled per default for all services via oslo.policy
        - 2025.2 wants to retire the `enforce_scope` options, enforcing the new behavior
    - remaining conflict with SCS downstream *implementation* of Domain Manager
        - mutually exclusive with `enforce_scope` in Keystone (limited to Keystone)
- adoption of new Secure RBAC should already be possible except for Keystone (because of Domain Manager)
    - could get rid of service-specific special roles in Barbican and Octavia
        - resulting role set would be streamlined across all services
    - however, upstream has not concluded migration, small issues/bugs might remain
        - especially in the 25% of services that currently have unknown support state
- Timeline of SCS adoption:
    - Standard would be to follow upstream and ship it with R8 in spring '25 when we ship 2024.2 (Dalmatian)
    - More aggresive adoption in fall '24 (2024.1, Caracal) might require a few backports (heat, keystone, possibly others)
    - Focus on upstreaming Domain Manager role
- Benefits of secure RBAC
    - (Finally!) avoid service-specific roles (octavia, barbican)
    - Get rid of barbican special case (normal member users can not create the secret needed to create encrypted volumes)
        - Can be worked around by policy adjustment until we get sec RBAC
        - Require this in the key-manager standard
            - Conditioned by delivering the key-manager API and by not (yet) having sec RBAC
