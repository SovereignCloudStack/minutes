## Agenda
### Updates on Security Topics:
* [#494](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/494) - Analysis of patches, software versions, services running, privilege escalation methods and network visibility within the context of a low privileged user in both testbed manager and nodes.
   * Intel [SA-00950 / #485](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/485). Tested the available [PoC](https://github.com/google/security-research/tree/master/pocs/cpus/reptar) on a VM running in a host with an affected processor. It caused the host to crash leading to a reboot (machine check as explained by researchers). Ubuntu already released a [security patch](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/intel-microcode/3.20231114.0ubuntu0.20.04.1) for the CPU microcode, so as SCS architecture is based in this SO it is mandatory to perform the necessary updates, even more if the provider is using affected processors.
* Cachewrap [#504](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/504)
* CVE reports to security@scs.community
    * None of them affected us
    * harbor issue double-checked by Davíd
* Open Redirect Security Advisory -> ¿Next steps?
### IAM:
* [registry.scs.community/scs-container-images/scs-keycloak:23.0.1](https://registry.scs.community/harbor/projects/22/repositories/scs-keycloak/artifacts-tab) built & pushed (manually)
    * depandabot could be useful to monitor upstream
    * Christian may have advice regarding Zuul automation vs dependabot
* documentation PR [#119](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/119)
    * link validation fails for relative links, asked Max for advice, blocked.
* [#405](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/405) – @gtema (Artem Goncharov) reviewed, Juanpe revised the patch, requested Artem again for advice, blocked.
    * database migration script missing
    * waiting for Artem's answer if we should change the approach
* [#453](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/453) – Automation by Zuul not yet understood
    * How shall the workflow look? Maybe simply initiated by pushing a new Dockerfile?
    * Maybe some service like renovate should be set up to open PRs when upstream release an update

### Domain Manager / Roles (@markus-hentsch)

- announcement regarding continuation by @josephineSei in 2024
    - secustack team will be disbandoned and transfer to C&H without @markus-hentsch. He will leave SCS by end of year. @josephineSei will take over. @markus-hentsch will stay until end of next week (15.12.2023). SCS team members should contact him in timely manner.
- upstream domain visibility fix for "GET /v3/domains" for Domain Managers ([#446](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/446))
    - patchsets contributed some weeks ago
        - https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone/+/900028
        - https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone-tempest-plugin/+/900545
    - been asking in the Keystone IRC for reviews and assistance regarding the failing Zuul test but no reaction so far
    - @fkr to connect @markus-hentsch and @josephineSei to people (Artem Gonachrov = @gtema) from Openstack to resove upstream issues, interest on this also from Cleura (Artem's employer)
- Domain Manager standard
    - small extension for Octavia role support ([PR#396](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/396)) merged
    - WIP rework for old and new RBAC standards ([PR#384](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/384)) to improve compatibility with Horizon and Terraform
        - currently debugging together with @berendt)
- Role standard ([PR#378](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/378))
    - base frame finished, core part about what role configurations to apply missing
    - currently looking into the best way to describe the core configuration in a release-agnostic way using policy generation and simple guidelines
- upstream the Domain Manager role ([#384](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/384))
    - current TODO for @markus-hentsch, writing an [Identity Spec](https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/keystone-specs/specs/template.html)
    - getting things upstream is a challenge. Joining the keystone weekly video meet (google meet) is a good way to get things going. @artificial-intelligence to look it up (done, sent to scs-tech mailing list)
