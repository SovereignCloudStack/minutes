## Topics

### IAM topics (@JuanPTM)

- Issue: [issues#596](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/596)
    - Multiple MR ([~~osism/ansible-playbooks~~](https://github.com/osism/ansible-playbooks/pull/403) MERGED, [~~scs/container-images~~](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/container-images/pull/8) MERGED, [~~scs/docs~~](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/190)) MERGED
- Issue: [issues#595](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/595)
    - Changes to the README on `container-images` explaining how to create a new image
    - [MR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/container-images/pull/9)
- Import CA into Keycloak [isssue#597](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/597)
    - Working on it
        - configmap into the initContainer mounted
        - Probably done by Friday
- We may need to move to container building in zuul also to apply the security policies / scanning tools.
    - There are jobs in the SCS zuul to build container images and push to our registry
        - Present in next week's meeting
        - Use @JuanPTM container build as guinea pig

### Security topics

#### Key Manager Standard (@josephineSei)
- PR https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/599
    - please review, thank you :)
- @artificial_intelligence asked for positive or negative examples of Plugins
    - this is not as trivial as it seems:
        - simple crypto can be used with Barbican running in an enclave, protecting the MasterKEK in the config (would not completely be a negative example)
        - using HSMs as positive example might scare CSPs - as it is a big financial burden
    - Could be part of the extra "testing and implementation notes" document

#### Taxonomy of failsafe levels (@josephineSei)
- PR for the DR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/579
- looking through the BSI classifications, these are too detailed - so we want to have something more high-level, but still understandable
    - and it is a litte bit from the other direction of thinking:
        - when you read a standard an it says it will onlyprotect agains level X of failure it already has a structure (from 1 only minor failures to 4 data center is lost)
    - Effects on KaaS should be added from the relevant team
        - Effects of physical failures (and software bugs) are different
        - The notes what needs to be done are different as well
        - The underlaying physical failures are the same, so we can reuse the "Risk Levels"
- Improve the description of the purpose
- Just asking for reviews

#### Pentesting (@90n20)
- Issue [#537](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/537)
    - PR to integrate weekly scans into the pipeline => [#6 Feat/weekly pipeline](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/pull/6)
        - Initial checks throw an error -> Tenant max timeout is set to 3 hours (10800 seconds). This may cause problems as full scans are performed and based on the number of targets this may take a lot of time (our tests showed that a single target take arounds 2 hours)
        - @o-otte can increase the global timeout
            - Already done: Base Job limit changed to 6hrs
            - Individual jobs can and should set lower limits
        - Create a dedicated image to save one hour?
            - Greenbone is difficult to really improve this way: When the scanning instance is started from fresh state, all feeds need to be parsed and loaded into memory and database
            - The only solution would be a dedicated instance, running continuously or VM RAM snapshots
            - Let's talk to Greenbone how this can be done better, but above is a good reason to take time and Greenbone is the best we have here
            - Decision: Doing our own optimization is not worth the effort/risk here, so no
    - Working on the documentation
        - Should end up on the docs page, also telling our Operator partners how to set this up
        - All markdown will be rendered on https://docs.scs.community/docs/operating-scs/components/automated-pentesting/overview
- CaaS Layer Scanning: Testing Trivy and Trivy operator deployment and run through a Zuul pipeline in demonstrator.
    - Â¿This should be integrated in the infra-scan-pipeline or made a specific one?
    - Different approach (more of a white-box test, needs credentials, may run at different frequency) -> separate pipeline
