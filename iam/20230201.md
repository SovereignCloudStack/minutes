### Sprint Review & Planning

The backlog has been refined last week, so sprint planning should be fairly easy ;)
Enjoy the session!

* https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/27

  - Need to schedule meeting with container team: @joshmue, @jschoone, @garloff, @janiskemper, @reqa, @JuanPTM
* Side discussion: Machine identities will not be federated via an ID broker, most likely
  - Running cross-provider workloads might question this assumption
  - @garloff to set up
