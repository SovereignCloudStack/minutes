* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/254
* ADR has been merged with status "Draft", to be stabilized after April 5th.
    * Please review & comment if need be

### Zitadel tests

* v2.22.2 deployed to Testbed
    * still lacks Device Authorizatin Grant Flow as well as Custom Claims

### PKCE in Keycloak OIDC

* The current solution PKCE is a working, but not optimal solution
    * it is not intended for our use case
* Authorization Code Flow would be the more suited way to proceed
* @reqa will address this during PTG
