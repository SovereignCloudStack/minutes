## Topics

### Role Standard
- Positive feedback from upstream 

### IAM topics (@JuanPTM)

- Issue: [issues#596](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/596)
    - Waiting for reviews
        - Added a script to the Keycloak container that generates the files needed for the example setup configuration
    - Multiple MR ([osism/ansible-playbooks](https://github.com/osism/ansible-playbooks/pull/403), [scs/container-images](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/container-images/pull/8), [scs/docs](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/190))
    - Docs are still not clear where to place them
        - Asked @maxwolfs
        - AI @garloff: Followup with @maxwolfs and @JuanPTM
            - Done, [feedback from Max](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/190#issuecomment-2136961400)

- Issue: [issues#595](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/595)
    - Changes to the README on `container-images` explaining how to create a new image
    - [MR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/container-images/pull/9)
        - Waiting for Reviews or ideas 

- Import CA into Keycloak [isssue#597](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/597) 
    - New proposal after talking with @reqa
        - Store all CA's into a volume and load them using an initContainer
    - Still researching if there is another way

 - Status update: Federation Keystone-Keycloak (@gtema)
     - backend driver like from [VexxHost](https://github.com/vexxhost/keystone-keycloak-backend/tree/main) is absolutely necessary
         - users/groups/user2groups are immediately visible in Keystone
         - possible to do regular roles assignments for users that have never logged in
         - disabled users get immediately disabled (can't use ApplicationCredentials, tokens any longer)
         - auth flow unaffected (still using std. OIDC flows)
     - mod_auth_oidc can be configured with `<LocationMatch></LocationMatch>` to eliminate need to restart apache2 when registering new domain/realm
         - A bit tricky due to lack of regexp support in `LocationMatch`
     - keystone supports domain specific drivers
         - can be configured on file system (requires restart of keystone when adding new domains) -> not a good option
         - can be configured in DB (requires small changes to Keystone to allow driver specific configuration). [API management](https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/identity/v3/index.html?expanded=token-authentication-with-scoped-authorization-detail#domain-configuration) is bit more tricky
             - Requires writing to DB to configure the domain specific settings
         - @gtema to discuss with Keystone maintainers
     - roles management should not be done in Keycloak
         - IdPs are not designed to manage service specific entities (only possible through workarounds that are doomed to fail at some point). Target system is reponsible for managing Authorization with IdP taking care of Authentication
             - Architectural view: IdP does not know about SP's resources, so expressing authorizations (roles) specific to resources ("projects", "domains", "clusters") inside IdP (or ID Broker) is not possible in a clean way
         - very error prone
         - a "yaml-like" config for region/project/user/group mapping allows GitOps approach for management and with backend driver easily possible
         - will not require improving Keystone mapper and introduction of Keycloak plugin to construct mappings


### Security (@90n20)

- Security pipeline
    - Python-docker problems seen on Zuul runs have been solved upstream (https://github.com/allenai/beaker-py/pull/277)
    - Greenbone CE blockers have been solved. Imports to DefectDojo are working now in our test Zuul instance. The main problem was related to "import-scan" api POST request and specifically to the "scan_type" variable. This is not directly documented on DefectDojo respository (https://defectdojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/integrations/api-v2-docs/), but in a deployed instance generated swagger-ui (ex: http://213.131.230.166:8080/api/v2/oa3/swagger-ui/). The scan_type selected is "OpenVAS Parser".
        - Next steps:
            - Create a new brach with weekly pipeline configuration and scripts
            - Document everything done until now 
            - Report doc issue to DefectDojo
- Container layer - Antonio (@Spectertj) keeps working on  deploying and making trivy work through a pipeline.
- TODO: Overall documentation how we do Security Scanning in SCS should be added to [docs.scs.community](https://docs.scs.community/) - starting point: https://docs.scs.community/docs/operating-scs/components/automated-pentesting/overview/
