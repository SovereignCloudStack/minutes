## Topics

### Root password

Related to https://github.com/osism/ansible-collection-commons/pull/671. We should
discuss if it is a good best practice to add a parameter that allows to set the
password of the root user.

=> when we have an operator account with password and possibility to elevate privileges there is no need to set password for root


### SCS security guide (@bitkeks)

- See https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/134
- Secustack results? Josephine, Markus
    - @markus-hentsch: we (secustack) focused more on the user-side (as in OpenStack API user) - a perspective that the upstream Security Guide is currently lacking; e.g. things to look out for when creating and sharing IaaS resources across projects
- Upstream OpenStack security guide status?
- CaaS security baseline standard? https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/475
- Discussion:
    - We need to provide a comprehensive entry point in our docs
    - CSP might be better covered, original motivation of issue was operators
    - End-users might also benefit from guides
    - @markus-hentsch: we have the [Secure Connections Standard in progress](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/548) that addresses some parts of the IaaS infrastructure concerning network connections
- Conclusion: @bitkeks picks up reviewing existing work, consolidating it into docs.scs
    - Primary target group: CSPs. Secondary: end-users


### IAM Topics (@JuanPTM)

- Issue: [issues#595](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/595)
    - Changes to the README on `container-images` explaining how to create a new image
    - [MR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/container-images/pull/9)
    - I'll contact @o-otte for Zuul integration
    - @o-otte: [PR zuul-config#37](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/zuul-config/pull/37) will add a Zuul Job for building and pusing images, still needs review
- Import CA into Keycloak [isssue#597](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/597)
    - [Ansible-collection MR](https://github.com/osism/ansible-collection-services/pull/1480)
    - [testbed MR](https://github.com/osism/testbed/pull/2261)

### Pentesting (@90n20)

- Issue [#537](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/537) - Infra Scan pipeline
    -  [#6 Feat/weekly pipeline](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/pull/6) has been merged.
        -  Due to last week Zuul problems, the pipeline was manually triggered yesterday. 
        -  It failed with multiple *"[Errno 2] No usable temporary directory found in ['/tmp', '/var/tmp', '/usr/tmp', '/home/ubuntu']"* after Greenbone CE architecture was created and feeds were updating. This error is usually triggered when the host runs out of space. 
        -  Running the same pipeline in our testing Zuul instance works as expected.
        -  Zap full scan was performed without problems and results can be seen in DefectDojo.
    - New [defectdojo](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/defectdojo) repo created via PR [Add defectdojo instance repo](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/github-manager/pull/271). It will contain ansible/terrfaorm files and scripts needed to deploy a functional DefectDojo instance.
        - Initial branch served with terraform scripts [feat/initial-deployment-scripts](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/defectdojo/tree/feat/ ping pull/7). It helps to reuse the code and avoids duplication. 
        -  Some of the proposed changes have to be modified as they mutate the pipeline behaviour (ex: ZAP daily test is not the same as the weekly one)
    - Documentation WIP
- Issue [#659](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/659) CaaS Layer Scanning
    - New [security-k8s-scan-pipeline](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-k8s-scan-pipeline) repo created via PR [Add repo security-k8s-scan-pipeline](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/github-manager/pull/270). Will be updated with the pipeline developed for k8s scanning using trivy and trivy operator.
        - Created branch [feat/initial-pipeline-setup](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-k8s-scan-pipeline/tree/feat/initial-pipeline-setup). WIP
    - Vulnerabilities of the cluster  and deployed containers -> DefectDojo.
    - Reports for SBOMs, Hardening Audit (k8s-cis) and secrets are also being generated, however those can not be imported -> artifacts.
        - Store them as zuul artifacts and fetch them via API or export? Where to?
        - Artifacts only available for limited amount of time if log rotation is enabled (and should be)
        - TODO: built persistent storage along side Zuul in updated setup, S3 or HTTP/FTP, for external job artifact storage
