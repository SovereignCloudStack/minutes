#### Keycloak deployment on k3s
- DONE: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/507
- TODO: Release notes
    - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/blob/feat/r6/Release6.md
- TLS cert import issue has been resolved
    - k8s magic, config map, init container does the certificate copying into Java keystore
    - Needs documentation how additional ones can be included
- TODO: janitoring / documentation
    - keystone OAuth2 client ID hidden in [osism/testbed/environments/infrastructure/secrets.yaml](https://github.com/osism/testbed/blob/main/environments/infrastructure/secrets.yml)
    - https://github.com/osism/testbed/tree/main/environments/kolla/files/overlays/keystone/federation/oidc - are those blobs still required?

#### Keystone (@JuanPTM)
- Invited Artem for video call about putting roles into Keystone token (instead of into the DB)
    - Meeting notes: https://input.scs.community/2024-scs-sig-iam
- [Issue #360](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/360) 
  - Merged: Limitations are documented now
- [Domain specific roles, Keystone patch](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone/+/907121)
    - No movement upstream

#### Roles (@markus-hentsch)
- Role Standard [issues#396](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/396)
    - pre-requirement: define list of mandatory and supported OpenStack services (to apply/test roles for)
    - main issue about service list: [issues#528](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/528)
    - @josephineSei started a HedgeDoc for categorizing services: https://input.scs.community/list-of-required-recommended-and-optional-openstack-projects?both
        - @all please contribute/comment to help figure out which services are needed
- Upstreaming of the Domain Manager Role [issues#384](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/384)
    - upstream wants to re-use existing "manager" role, not introduce a new "domain-manager" role
        - "manager" role can be assigned with domain-scope and with project-scope, domain scope includes IAM capabilities
    - policy integration will be transferred from our work on the dedicated domain-manager role
    - spec was adjusted to call it Domain Manager Persona instead (because it will not be a dedicated role)
        - check docs to avoid confusing ourselves / our users
        - Admonition: "We used the term domain-manager before, please transition to use manager role with domain scope."
        - Double-check that we are not dependant on RBAC work that has not yet landed in our release (2023.2/Bobcat) -> @markus-hentsch
- Related discussion: tokens and roles
    - Federated users get an unscoped token
    - role assignment table
