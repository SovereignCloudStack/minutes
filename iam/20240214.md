## Agenda

### Keycloak on management/control-plane k3s (@reqa)

- Targeting RC1 with better keycloak integration ...
    - What has been achieved, what is missing?
- Alignment in integration has happened [#507](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/507)
    - deployment with CloudNativePG operator works
    - TLS working
    - osism/ansible-playbooks: keycloak-oidc-client-config adjusted to work against k3s pod
        - better way to inject configuration changes might be a config map (and an operator the regularly checks on it) -- middle ground might be to use existing REST API
    - pull requests towards OSISM:
        - https://github.com/osism/ansible-playbooks/pull/361
        - https://github.com/osism/ansible-collection-services/pull/1296
    - blocked by strange ansible-lint and molecule CI failures
    - Maybe can be integrated as Kubernetes job in Zuul?
- Container image building [#509](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/509)
    - 23.0.6 pulled and working

### Keystone (@JuanPTM)
- Allow assignment of domain specific role to federated users: [gerrit MR](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone/+/907121) - may need one more +1?
- Move roles into keystone token (like groups)?
    - Upstream discussion (w/ @gtema) seems useful

### Roles
- Upstreaming the Domain Manager role is progressing (slowly), secure RBAC-based implementation
    - Old way will be used until implementation is completed, running against deprecation
    - Reference: https://governance.openstack.org/tc/goals/selected/consistent-and-secure-rbac.html
- Please provide feedback: "Draft: Roles Standard" https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/378
- Standard needs to be adapted to current state / availability
- Maybe promoting the Domain Manager persona would be faster
- @josephineSei to visit IaaS call for a discussion there (Feb 21)
- Q: How does Keycloak's federation mapping work with OpenStack scopes? 
    - Reference: https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/2023.1/admin/federation/mapping_combinations.html


### Pentesting

- Status of assessments? Evaluation finished?
    - Low and High privileged user assesments finished over testbed manager and nodes.
        - They were performed with and without hardening being enabled.
        - Results and recommendations uploaded to SCS nextcloud instance. See [#494](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/494) and [#521](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/521) for links
    - Updated [#410](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/410). 
        - We are performing a pentest within an instance deployed in a project on testbed. Security from a "cloud user" prespective. New issue to track this? 

### Security-Pipeline

- Containerized tools updates [#526](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/526#issuecomment-1942248737)
    - ProjectDiscovery: Official containers available with latest versions of the tools.
    - ZAP: Official containers avaialble on 4 different formats. We suggest to use weekly or bare ones. Automation configuration should be provided on runtime according to pentesting needs.
    - Greenbone CE: Official container deployment is too heavy, consisting on a distributed service architecture with several dedicated containers. We are testing other alternatives: 
        - Unofficial single container images ([immauss](https://immauss.github.io/openvas/)).
        - Develop our own single containerized solution.
    - Possibility to expand the proposed methodology, defining two different pipelines instead of one:
        - Daily: Fast, with less intensive tools and passive scanning (Naabu + Httpx + Nuclei + Zap Baseline Scan)
        - Weekly/major commit or releases: Slow, using all tools and active scanning (Naabu + Httpx + Nuclei + Zap Full Scan + Greenbone CE)
    - Recommendation: Weekly, and Zuul VM will bootstrap the Docker compose setup for OpenVAS (leaving to solve the problem of feed data persistence)
- Semi-blocked attemping to deploy our own Zuul instance to test the pipelines and tools implementation/configuration.
    - Create new repo to store security pipeline zuul configs
