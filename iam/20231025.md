### B1 TLRZ support status
* [#650](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/650)
* Solved!
    * Certificates issue. Horizon didn't log anything about it :-(
        * Self-signed certificates, not imported into horizon
        * Solution to not check SSL is not what we want to recommend, rather document how to import/trust your custom CA
        * Shouldn't this be detectable by looking at the logs? => Horizon bug. (Don't invest days of work, though.)
