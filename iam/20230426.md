## Agenda
* Exploring connecting k8s IAM to IdP ([issues/#307](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/307))
    * @jschoone, @joshmue, @reqa working on this in the SIG IAM
    * Learning sessions -- need to create a setup manually once, so we understand how to standardize and automate it
    * Starting with username/password auth
    * Scripts from @reqa
        * From [this how to](https://scribe.rip/@charled.breteche/kind-keycloak-securing-kubernetes-api-server-with-oidc-371c5faef902)
        * Tested by @jschoone (using public zitadel cloud to avoid cert issues)
        * Continuing testing with keycloak
    * @jschoone to add the learnings into #307
* Two CAs in testbed? - https://github.com/osism/testbed/issues/1402#issuecomment-1519907793
    * Change in OSISM caused this, is a bug, needs proper fix from OSISM
    * Workaround available (copy certs), so it's not currently blocking IAM team
    * Workaround should be documented in the bug report, so it can be analyzed, possibly also contributing a proper fix as PR (@reqa)

* Followup from last week:
    * Issue: mod_auth2 problem [ Regression: Federated OIDC login broken in R4/zed keystone container #313 ](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/313) -- Pull request towards testbed ongoing.
        * Config parameter required for Zed to make it work again
        * Can not be set unconditionally in testbed as it breaks Yoga
            * Create config option, which is enabled by default in Zed
            * PR open with this approach

    * Issue: keystone restart [ Spike: Re-configuring keystone OIDC federation for additional customer realms #314 ](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/314) -- Experiment shows that apache reload/graceful restarts the container always.
        * `docker exec keystone_container apachectl graceful_restart` (or so) did not work, same for `SIHUP`, `SIGUSR1`, always restarts container
            * ~2s downtime
        * Maybe connected to the way apache is ran inside the container?
            * dumb-init calls kolla-start running apache things with -D foreground 
        * Maybe we can cause apache to pick up new files without restart?
            * Wiki page on multi-IdP setup suggests this works https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/wiki/Multiple-Providers

    * keycloak ADR update
        * [Draft for ADR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0300-v1-requirements-for-sso-identity-federation.md)
        * Track this: [standards/#269](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/269)

    * Put PS recommendations into a proposal / RFC
        * Convert the plusserver proposals about group naming convention etc. from  https://input.scs.community/2023-scs-iam-minihackathon#Brainstorming-Notes into an ADR draft under https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/tree/main/Drafts (Template: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-XXXX-vN-template.md)

            * "Removing a user’s role assignment on a project will invalidate the user’s application credentials for that project."
