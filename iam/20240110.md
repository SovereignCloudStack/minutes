### Security (Pentesting)
* Sec Advisory reptar and cachewarp
    * Blog post created and published on main site: [intel-amd-cpu-vulns](https://scs.community/2024/01/03/intel-amd-cpu-vulns/)
* Low privileged user assessment [#494](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/494). Document auditing tools results (linPEAS, lynis and OpenSCAP).
* No response about OpenSearch vuln from maintainers. 
    * Their SAST bot published yesterday an [issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/issues/5674) related to redirects in one of their dependencies. They solved it with the PR [#5669](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/pull/5669). We should check if it is related to the found vulnerability.
    * Resend contact emails this month.
* Document pentesting methodology (tools, procedures, etc)

### Keycloak deployment
* Keycloak on k3s [#507](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/507)
* Container building [#509](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/509)
* Can we close keycloak overlay image [#453](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/453) as completed?
* Is the IAM documentation completed [#397](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/397)?
    * Yes, we'll need to touch it once the move to k3s is complete, but that can be tracked in a new issue ...

### Keystone
* Federated users in non-default domains [#405](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/405)
* JuanPTM still working on [upstream patch](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone/+/739966) acceptance (Rafael Weingartner - original author)
    * Current version requires preprovision of projects and roles
    * The patch is failing, roles still require to be in the same domain as the IdP
    * Feedback written on gerrit
        * Custom (per-domain) roles are not supported
            * They may be common with domain-managers having the power to create them
        * Maybe this will need to be addressed in a second step
            * Discuss with Artem and Rafael
* While testing a issue was found on the testbed [#510](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/510)
    * The issue has been already fixed by @reqa and @berendt

### Roles (Markus -> Josephine)
* Domain Manager
    * domain manager role proposed upstream ([#384](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/384))
        - bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/2045974
        - spec: https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone-specs/+/903172
    * Domain scoping for domain list [#446](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/446)
    * Document role [#385](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/385)
    * Achieve Horizon and Terraform compatibility for the Domain Manager standard [383](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/383)
        * waiting for review from @cberendt
* General role standard
    * role standard ([#396](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/396))
        - draft written but stuck, see [comment here](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/396#issuecomment-1852491416)
        - policy defaults and settings are very complicated, hard to define a consistent and working standard for all services (while keeping domain manager compatibility)
        - needs more research and testing, see the github issue above for details
