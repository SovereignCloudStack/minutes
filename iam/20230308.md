### Next steps for IAM?

* Discussion of Hackathon results?
* @reqa elaborates on what has happened during the hackathon
* @jnull and @reqa worked with devstack and the openid connect provider digging into a potential security problem
    * the current oidc approach uses the implicit grant which is considered insecure
    * the modern approach is authorization code grant with PKCE

    * this screams for a blogpost
