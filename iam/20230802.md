#### Domain admin role concept from @markus-hentsch
- [issues/#184](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/184): significant progress
- Notes in https://input.scs.community/2023-scs-team-iaas?both (2023-08-02)
- Review from IAM perspective
    - e.g. What standard roles should exist? "auditor", "project member", "domain manager", "admin" with what rights? (Do we even want to have per service rights?)
- Quota handling, Pentesting TBD
- Structure work in IAM hacking session (Fri 10:05 CEST)

#### keycloak integration into keystone from VexxHost
- Review [Vexxhost approach](https://github.com/vexxhost/keystone-keycloak-backend)

#### user management / user lifecycle
- e.g. add user U to project B and remove from project A in keycloak
    - user U appears to still have rights to project A
        - caused by shadow users (from keycloak) -> BUG
        - seems to work (after some time) for group membership?
            - trouble with multi-group memberships #361
    - Contact with Kristi Nicola
        - new presentation at Vencouver Summit '23
