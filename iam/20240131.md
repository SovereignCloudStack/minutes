### keycloak on management/control-plane k3s (@reqa/@JuanPTM)
* TBD: Where to put the umbrella Helm chart in a way that it can consume configuration parameters (domain name, TLS certs etc.)
    * First step is to have PR against testbed
    * Second step to update te keycloak role in ansible-collection-services
        * see [507#issuecomment-1917940350](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/507#issuecomment-1917940350)
        * Trying to get it in before RC0, RC1 as fallback
* [Automate container creation using zuul #3](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/container-images/pull/3)
    * Merged, but workflows fails.
        * Needs repository secret (not environment secret) @garloff
        * Will also need zuul secrets ... (@JuanPTM, @o-otte)
    * @o-otte works on a generalized Zuul Job template in [issue#518](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/518). Only needed to specify Harbor Credentials as secret and path to containerfile.

### Sec/Pentesting (@bitkeks)
* Info only: 
    * Meeting yesterday regarding proposal for security scanner pipeline (CI/CD integration: trigger dynamic pentests, not static analysis)
    * Current work on assessments against testbed (evaluation of reports)
    * Following work: implementation of scanner proposal
        * Containerize scanning tools
        * Collect results on server
* Will need zuul jobs/pipelines for triggered and regular runs ...
    * zuul runs (ansible) playbooks
    * @o-otte to support @90n20/@seykotron
* Uploaded preliminary sheet with testbed manager and nodes assessment in NextCloud.
* Got some troubles setting up connectivity to testbed test project default instance to launch internal test through it. Seems to be something related to network configuration and dhcp not working as expected. Solved creating a new instance with proper port and floating IP. Will report it to OSISM testbed repo.
    * Pre-created network in preconfigured test project seems to fail. New, manually created instance works. Report to OSISM (testbed repo): [OSISM #2031](https://github.com/osism/testbed/issues/2031) (@90n20)
