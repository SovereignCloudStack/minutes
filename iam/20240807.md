## Agenda


### Security report storage in S3 (@spectertj)

* Pipeline now retrive all reports from k8s(trivy operator) and upload it to openstack swift
* Code was adapted to use openstack swift
* Code uploaded and ready for testing
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-k8s-scan-pipeline/compare/main...feat/s3-upload
    * Duplicated code between the two branches
* The implementation is based on pull-method. But push is way better fitting for this approach. So we now switch to push-approach
    * Skips the Zuul-dependency
    * Credential handling difficult in both directions: either Kubernetes credentials in pull-approach or Vault credentials in push
* Discussion about further steps
    * The Trivy Operator stores its report in the Kubernetes API
        * Simple approach: Use Zuul to execute kubectl to fetch the resource objects
    * The [trivy-dojo-report-operator](https://github.com/telekom-mms/trivy-dojo-report-operator) pushes the vulnerability reports into DefectDojo. This ignores other report types from Trivy
    * Idea: "Kubernetes CronJob that fetches all Report CRs and pushes them to S3."
        * We go with this one :rocket:
    * Upstream: "open an issue to export reports to S3? https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-operator"
        * Good approach, but more complex since it needs Go code and testing
    * What about the container image that might be needed?
        * If it's just a bash one-liner, an existing container image should be used. E.g. Python or kubectl image
        * If a new image is needed (why?) it can be hosted in SCS Harbor
* Artem gives overview over an example job to display the usage of Vault/OpenBAO agent in Kubernetes jobs/pods
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/system-config/blob/main/kubernetes/zuul/components/zuul-backup/job.yaml
    * Good template for the Trivy exporter job
    * Resolves the dependency on Zuul, but introduces dep on Vault. But can easily be removed and credentials put in the job itself
