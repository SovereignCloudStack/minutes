## Agenda
### Sprint Jena: Intermediate status
* Last full sprint before R5
#### Gap between Upstream/Testbed work and OSISM production status
* Lack of complete understanding which code in OSISM repos is shared, and which one is separate between testbed and production and CiaB
    * So we lack understanding which of our work will even hit production deployments
    * And we can not test in production
        * Proper deployment needed to test?
        * AI @garloff: Organize meeting OSISM + IAM team, ask for OSISM contribution documentation / graphs / ...
        * Invite

#### Pentesting
* Testbed deployment has been performed
    * Assumption is that testbed and real prod env are very similar
    * Found externally exposed services on manager
        * traefik
        * Need to ensure that these are properly protected on production environments
        * In testbed, exposure via ssh/wireguard tunnel
        * AI @garloff: discuss with OSISM (@berendt), copying @90n20
            * On this particular finding
            * On how to best report/discuss potential security issues
    * OpenStack security group rules found to allow anything from anywhere for the VMs that run the SCS testbed
        * no 1:1 correspondance to product exists (the VMs are bare metal machines there, possibly protected by hardware firewalls ...)
        * Investigate whether better protection for testbed is useful
        * AI @90n20: report as issue (can be public)

#### IAM documentation for R5
* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/tree/main/operations/iam
    * Needs to be made visible (after updating)
    * Blog article wanted
    * Release Notes will mention Blog 
#### R5 features
* Horizon Logout fix needs to be copied from Testbed to Prod.Rollout
    * If it is relevant at all for production currently?
    * Need better understanding
* Keycloak <-> Keystone Identity Mapping
    * Multi-value groups working now, bad upstream docs
        * Upstream bug report (against Docs) and improvement wanted
* Keycloak customer realm <-> Keycloak proxy realm <-> Keystone
    * Shadow user / Ephemeral keystone account: No way to create it in the right OpenStack domain (but always in the default domain)
        * AI @reqa: Create issue to track this (and to link the upstream bug report also)
        * Done: [Issue #405](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/405)

#### Domain-manager role
#### Miscellaneous
* Review progress, any help needed?
