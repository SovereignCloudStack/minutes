## Recurring items & housekeeping
* Minutes transfer and community call reporting: @JuanPTM
* New participant: Daniel Poelzleithner (B1)

## Agenda

### Domain Manager Standard

* Update for Horizon and Terraform Compatability seems to work.
* Change is ready to merge: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/384
    * Question from @josephineSei: do we want to have the full policy file within the standard? -> we may need to adjust just the policy file in future
    * who should merge this?
    * Can be merged after the call @JosephineSei (resolving markdownlint fail)

### Roles
* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/396#issuecomment-1927153706
    * Old vs. new policies option
        * old will not yet be unsupported
        * wait for a more mature
    * Will break users moving between SCS clouds
    * Slow upstream progress (spanning multiple OpenStack projects)
        * Need to define which projects we need covered
* Proposal: Stick to old for some longer time to avoid divergence b/w SCS clouds
    * Use time to work out plan and implementation some more before switching all (as simultaneously as possible) to the new world (and create some migration automation)

* New policies:
    * admin role assignment - very powerful role!
    * Need to [document](https://docs.scs.community/docs/iam/) that this must not be assigned to a customer
        * Write down out mental view of roles: (global) admin - domain manager - project member - reader
        * Document what is not there yet (e.g. under https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/tree/main/docs/05-iam) - @reqa
        * Don't do XYZ (like assign admin to someone that should manage a domain or a project)

### keycloak on management/control-plane k3s (@reqa)
* Worked on [#507](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/507)
    * cnpg initially was not intended to support more than one DB per cnpg-cluster-instance
https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/discussions/497
      * credo: 
          * at least one cloudnative-pg-cluster per kubernetes namespace
          * needs to be verified: can we have multiple pg clusters in a namespace?
          * needs to be verified: can we have multiple databases in a cloudnative-pg-cluster? (the officeal documentation suggests that on some places)
    * Will not make RC0 - goal is RC1
    * Need session with CB to understand the integration into testbed (for testing, surprise) and into production
        * Labeling needed (for placement)
        * Magical hostname keycloak.testbed.osism.xyz currently resolves to 192.168.16.5, should be 192.168.16.100 in the future (?)

* Roles in keystone
    * Group memberships are in tokens, roles assignments are written to DB
    * Needs fixing (long-term) and documentation (short-term)
    * Contact Kristi/Artem/... for clarification
    * [Docs PR #360](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/138)
    * Allow domain specific roles on federated users
        * [Gerrit MR](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone/+/907121)
        * Backports wanted!

* Container image build & push
    * Pipelines working
        * Issue with connection being reset while pushing
    * New [PR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/container-images/pull/5) to create the new Keycloak image (23.0.6)


### Sec/Pentesting (@bitkeks, @90n20)

* Results from re-assessment with hardened testbed?
    * Hardening index slightly better
    * Low privs:
        * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/494#issuecomment-1931636150
        * manager: passed rules 149 / failed rules 180 (vs 131/114)
        * nodes: passed rules 144 / failed rules 178 (vs 125/115)
    * High privs:
        * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/521#issuecomment-1931648830
        * manager: passed rules 156 / failed rules 182 (vs 131/123)
        * nodes: passed rules 151 / failed rules 180 (vs 127/122)
    * Difference in numbers stems from services that are started in hardened mode, which create new test cases and checks
        * Surprised that hardening seems to increase the attack surface! (audit ...)
* Security pipeline creation
    * Containerized tools currently checked in Lab
    * Will be tracked in a new issue in github (@bitkeks)
* OSISM patch status?
    * Reported and solved by OSISM: [#2031](https://github.com/osism/testbed/issues/2031) / [PR #2032](https://github.com/osism/testbed/pull/2032)
        * Fixed IP assignment did not work
