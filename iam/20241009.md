## Agenda

### Federated IAM
* Discussion: [shared](https://input.scs.community/#Shared-configuration) vs [individual realm](https://input.scs.community/#Isolated-tenant-configuration-individual-realm)
    * In both cases, login page is either IdP specific or we offer global button "log in with IdP XXX"

#### Shared
* Advantage: All users end up in the same DB
* Listing users that have access to the tenant works well (looking at the grant table)
* Finding new users to get added is harder
    * Data privacy issues, can not publish complete list (for size and data provacy reasons)
    * Offer search options? (github e.g. supports keeping email addresses private, users decide how much is visible)
    * Or know the identity and send invite
        * github also allows to keep membership private (not visible outside of tenant)
* Optimized well for inidividuals
* Corporate identities would grant access to tenants

##### How to add external IdPs in shared config
* Needs a UI/API to connect the IdP
    * Redirect from login screen
        * Can not list of corporate IdPs on login screen
        * Dedicated (IdP dependent) login pages
        * Or: Redirect based on user name (e.g. mail domain)
            * Discloses existence of user (makes brute force attacks easier)
            * Requires user to be already known (prior login or preprovisioning/SCIM or name-based rules, the latter being risky)
    * Preprovisioning discussion
        * Tenant admin registers corporate directory as IdP
        * Fetching all users is a problem
            * Filtering?
            * Credentials to fetch data may implicitly result in filters ...
        * Only users that have access rights/grants need to be preprovisioned, how to filter these?


### Security
* WIP: Documentation extension about tools and reports
* WIP: Checking logs about why pipeline is failing
* Creation of PR to review all advance
* Researching of SBOM tooling
