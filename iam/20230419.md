## Agenda

### Kurt to take over IAM team PO role from felix

### Reference: Results from the Mini-Hackathon

#### Decisions
* Focus on using keycloak in the reference implementation for now
    * Keep eyes open to not exclude providers chosing alternatives, but focus own reference implementation to work well with keycloak
    * ToDo: Update ADR
        * Keycloak set, but our implementation will allow other backends to be hooked in, if someone wants to do it
* keystone should always federate to SCS-delivered ID-Broker (keycloak in ref.impl.), so this config is standard -- a bit more complexity to have clouds enabled for federation always
    * Federation can be identities from another SCS cloud, user directory from a company (OIDC/SAML) or a 3rd party OIdC/OAuth provider.
    * Mapping needed: Mapping attributes/claims from IdP to roles/groups/... and ultimately authorizations in SP
    * Also keeps us flexible to connect to SSIDs (Gaia-X) like in the Walt.ID PoC during Gaia-X Hackathon #4
* While IdP flows for authorization ... are well standardized with OIDC (and optionally SAML), configuring IAM (e.g. configuring mappings, setting up federations, ...) is not and needs standardization.
    * This cloud be an SCS defined API or possibly one built on top of existing IdP APIs such as keycloak APIs, TBD.
    * Self-service (GUI/API) for IAM needed
* k8s connection to ID Broker/IdP (keycloak realm / IdP Organization / domain) wanted
    * https://developer.okta.com/blog/2021/11/08/k8s-api-server-oidc
    * https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts/
    * Approach: Configure k8s api to accept members of a specific group to be granted cluster-admin access, see [issues/#307](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/307)
    * More flexible, fine-grained policies possible with call-backs (k8s authorization webhooks)
* Get Cleura, OTC, CatalystCloud into the Lean Coffee to share their customer portal approach (and workflows) for customer onboarding / self-managing clouds and their use of domains / domain admins
* Pursue k8s workload identities further: 
* Workload identities wanted: https://www.figma.com/file/2snrqaKB2e1XCz2MXEDKD0/IAM-Hackathon-20230413?node-id=56-912&t=GdMcyarqsHT4jBCT-0

#### Needed decisions/work
* Onboarding automation and OpenStack project management is currently provider-specific ("customer management portal"); needs to be addressed either via OpenStack (domain-admin/manager role) improvements or SCS standards around it.
    * ToDo: Understand OTC setup (they have a somewhat clean domain admin role), possibly also Cleura
    * High-level process description can be done anyway already
        * Create customer in CRM and billing (outside of SCS scope)
            * Anti-fraud measures
        * Create realm or so in IdP
        * Connect OpenStack domain ... to it
        * Create default project, default groups, assign users, ...
            * PS to document their best practices
                * https://input.scs.community/2023-scs-iam-minihackathon#Brainstorming-Notes
* One provider not convinced that tenants should have an OpenStack domain (connected to an IdP realm) assigned, needs further research and reasoning
* Customer management portal to allow for several roles, so a reseller role can be implemented
* Local user management: Go with built-in keycloak features for local users or deploy UCS for this? Or both?
    * UCS uses openldap, exposes via OIDC/SAML, brings own GUI
    * If keycloak alone is good enough for most cases (where you don't have external IdP), we would avoid complexity. If we need UCS anyway, we might want to avoid supporting/recommending keycloak local users.
    * @reqa to collect information and come back with recommendation
    * Might impact choice of SCS IdM management APIs
* OpenStack application credentials: Research needed: Do they outlive the user who created them?


#### Needed user stories / epics
* When adding realms to make them known to keystone: `docker exec apachectl reload` or so should suffice. Research needed: Does it not?
* HA work for keycloak -- requires k8s cluster ~~on management plane~~ somewhere (or hacking HA things into ansible/docker construct)
    * cluster won't be available in the next weeks
    * Option 1: defer the work until the cluster is available
    * Option 2: create a temp cluster to deploy keycloak on
    * investigate already existing Helm charts
...
* Research on APIs suitable to manage IdPs/Identity brokers

#### Created user stories
* [issues/#307](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/307) - k8s to accept predefined IdP groups as authorized
* [issues/#308](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/308) - cert-manager DNS auth integration
* [issues/#309](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/309) - Setup testbed federation with scs.sovereignit.de OIDC provider


### Sprint planning
* User-Story: Investigate mod_oauth2 problem in Ubu22.04 / Zed (@reqa to create issue)
* User-Story (research): keystone restart / apache reload for realm addition (@reqa to create issue to track this)
* Epic: [issues/#307](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/307) k8s using IdP via OIDC
    * User-Stories needed: OpenID discovery etc., determining realm (name & endpoint) (@jschoone, @joshmue, @reqa) - We need a convention for naming realms to find the OIDC discovery document like `https://keycloak.testbed.osism.xyz/auth/realms/_THE_REALM_NAME_/.well-known/openid-configuration`
* Epic: Tooling for customer onboarding (IAM and OpenStack)
    * Document PS approach, put up for discussion as ADR (@garloff)
* User Story (research): OpenStack app creds lifecycle (@garloff)
    * See https://youtu.be/GBRhXBWFpRY?t=515 (and subsequent video section)
* Epic: Tooling / API for creating federations and role mappings
    * See also https://youtu.be/GBRhXBWFpRY?t=515 - groups and mapping to project-role need to be pre-created in keystone
