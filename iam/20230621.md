### Progress from last week: 

#### Hack session: Domain admin role secure?
* Hack session happened, and continued
* Details captured in [#184](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/184)
    * Admin rights can be scoped to domains or projects, but that is not enforced by OpenStack in our current configuration
    * Members are properly limited to the scope of their project/domain
    * Conclusion: Admin permissions can not be granted to customers with the current state of our implementation
    * Is this a configuration issue? Write policies? Or do we even need to do code changes?
        * Policy writing should happen *together*
            * Together also with upstream OpenStack
            * Policies are per-service (but the "domain admin" would only need elevated "admin" rights in keystone, no other service)
            * Thus: Long-term plan :-(
        * https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/keystone-specs/specs/keystone/ongoing/policy-goals-and-roadmap.html
        * https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/968696
        * Set up session for this, Fri IAM hacking session, after vacation season -- want OpenStack Public Cloud and maybe Keystone participants

#### Side-discussion: OS_* environment vs. containerized openstackclient
* Should deprecate old-style (openrc) way of using it in favor of `clouds.yaml/secure.yaml` and `--os-cloud=`
* ToDo @garloff: Open issue to ensure we do

#### Roles ADR: Tracked by [#352](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/352) now

#### [#314](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/314) adding realms requires container restarts
- @JuanPTM working on the related logout issue with proxy realms [#347](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/347)
    - Patch/Workaround from Kristi Nikolla partially successful: Logout from Horizon (cookies), keystone, Keycloak proxy realm (`OSISM`) works but the final logout from the "customer realm" doesn't happen.
    - Another approach - auto-redirect would avoid the need for workaround, but we could not (yet?) get it to work

#### [#254](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/254) ADR for IdP features
- should stabilize today if there are no vetos in [PR #302](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/302)
- merged & closed

#### [#317](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/317) PS domain/groups/projects/roles creation recommendations
- PS *is* using domains (even if Ralf questions the need/desirability)
- Meeting on user federation happened: @reqa notes: AI @reqa

#### [#345](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/345) s(ha)256 usage instead of plain code exchange
- merged & closed

#### [#293](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/293) device auth code flow upstream
- waiting for reviewathon (e.g. this Friday 2023-06-23) - not blocking us currently.

#### Ongoing epics [#25](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/25), [#182](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/182), [#191](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/191)
What do we need to refine to get closer to completion?
* [#182](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/182): This is about understanding how all the described scenarios would work and then documenting them

#### [#307](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/307) IdP control of cluster-admin access
- @reqa helped @jschoone to setup keycloak on testbed
    - oidc parameters are set on API server
    - kubectl helper script adjusted
    - API server currently not reaching the testbed network
