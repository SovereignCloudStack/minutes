## Agenda

### Planning R7 IAM (@garloff, @reqa)
- Cleanup https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/27
- User management in keycloak for Container Layer
- Onboarding a new customer (with federation): Workflow documentation
    - Certificate import
- Keycloak container build [#509](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/509)
    - document and show -- how to rebuild in case of a fixed bug [#526](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/526)
    - how to consume it (e.g. in testbed)
    - next step (new issue) -> zuul
    - @scoopex added a possible hackaton item: https://input.scs.community/Hy0HqULMTGeeVIcy0vmBgA#


### Finalize OpenStack keystone work (@garloff, @reqa)
- domain list visibility [#446](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/446) (backport needed?)
- federated users in default domain [#405](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/405) - backport wanted?
- domain specific roles [#523](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/523) - backport wanted?
- domain-scoped manager role [#184](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/184), [#384](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/384)
    - Also wanted: Create federation trust relationships via self-service (by domain manager persona)
- roles on first login [#360](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/360)
    - Idea is to reset keystone roles on every login
    - Upstream bug? -> under investigation
- Consistent role concept [#396](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/396)
    - Blocked by "mandatory services" issue, [#528](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/528)


### Pentesting pipeline (@90n20)

- DefectDojo demo (http://213.131.230.166:8080). Instance deployed in Minery plusserver project space (Gaia-X Demonstrator).  As for now we are injecting Daily scans from the pipeline deployed in our own Zuul instance. Everything seems to work as expected.
  - As suggested by @bitkeks we are investigating if it is possible to perform authentication via GitHub OAuth2 (official documentation only mentions GitHub Enterprise)
  - It is worth mentioning that it is possible to integrate authentication with KeyCloak.
 - ZAP and Greenbone scans in pipeline => WIP: They particular characteristics are still blocking our progress. Slow advancements are being made.

### Security: xz backdoor aka CVE-2024-3094 (@bitkeks)

- Easter surprise: backdoor in open source library for lzma/xz compression algorithm
- More details here: https://gist.github.com/thesamesam/223949d5a074ebc3dce9ee78baad9e27
- For SCS: Check if the xz-utils packages with versions `5.6.0` or `5.6.1` exist
    - They are so fresh, no stable Linux distro should have them in their repositories
    - There will be no extra advisory from SCS side
