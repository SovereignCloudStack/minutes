## Agenda

### Security infra pipelines (@bitkeks, @90n20)

* There's multiple PRs in the infra pipeline repo looking at performance of VMs. How do we proceed?
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/pull/10
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/pull/11
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/pull/13
    * Currently issues with gx-scs (starting VMs stall
* We should also add limits to the triggers of Zuul pipelines so they do not run in full when e.g. a license file is updated
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/issues/14
    * Filtering is hard: Only trigger when certain files are changed (inclusive approach) or not triggering on certain files (exclusive approach)
    * Differentiation between base and full job -- ensure that [PR#10](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/pull/10) does not break that differentiation
        * suffix `-test` indicates that we just check whether the test pipeline works, without suffix we have a full ("production") test run
        * avoid putting everything into base job
        * variables with yaml anchors make things reusable
* ToDo: Look into SBOM generation via pipelines
    * Assumption is that we have a yaml file with a list of artifacts
        * Works also with artifacts that come from other registries also
        * Scan results end up in depdency track
        * save/publish SBOM artifacts
    * AI @gtema: Drive the creation of the yaml
        * Release-Notes repository is the right place
        * Future: Maybe rename the repo to Release-Artifacts or so (if we can avoid broken links)


### IAM (@garloff, @gtema, @juanptm)

* Drawing the bigger IAM picture based on the input from the [IAM workshop](https://input.scs.community/Workshop-IAM-20240830#)
* Working on a [requirements and design document](./scs-federation.md#)
    * May need splitting
    * Please contribute

### Domain Manager Standard (@markus-hentsch)

- upstreaming almost done
    - feature merged! -> domain manager will be available natively starting with OpenStack 2024.2
    - upstream documentation and tempest test additions currently under review
- currently, SCS will be based on 2024.1 = no native domain manager feature yet, only optional downstream implementation via policies as per SCS Domain Manager standard
    - with a future SCS release (as soon as 2024.2 or later lands in SCS), native integration will take over and the downstream implementation will be discontinued
        - issue tracking the planned discontinuation: [issues#723](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/723)
- Using Domain-Manager inside C&H?
    - Under evaluation at C&H
    - Federation not required in the current projects
