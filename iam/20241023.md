## Agenda

### Sec
* Infra Scan pipeline (90n20):
    * Documentation enhancement ([Draft PR#16](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/pull/16)): How can reports can be leveraged by CSPs/Operators/Users to include them in their day to day routines.
    * Issues ([Issue#15](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/issues/15)): scs-baseline-security-scan is failing on Zuul with no aparent reason. We have been reading logs in order to understand what is happening as some triggers work and others do not Â¿maybe it is a node/worker failure?
        * zuul logs not helpful, unfortunately
        * Possibly, will wait for @gtema and @o-otte to look into this

* K8s Scan pipeline (specterj):
    * [Draft PR#4](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-k8s-scan-pipeline/pull/4):
        * Code has been modified to upload reports to the S3 bucket in order to have fewer lines, be easier to understand and to add improvements, like error handling. 
        * Retries have been reduced in the execution of trivy containers when scanning. This reduces hang times when the pipeline fails.
    * WIP: Documentation changes
