### CVE-2024-1086 (@artificial-intelligence)

- "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The nft_verdict_init() function allows positive values as drop error within the hook verdict, and hence the nf_hook_slow() function can cause a double free vulnerability when NF_DROP is issued with a drop error which resembles NF_ACCEPT."
	- **Linux kernels affected: v3.15-rc1 to v6.8-rc2**
