## Agenda
### Welcome Antonio!
- stepping in for Miguel (paternal leave)
- Cybersecurity / DevSecOps expert

### Neutron Policy Standard (@josephineSei)
- network rbac endpoint can be used to share various networking resources
- sharing those resources may have a security impact (e.g. security groups can be altered, networks shared as external)
- Issue: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/543
- should we require this endpoint to be accessed by admins only?
    - This would make the functionality unavailable for mere mortals in a public cloud scenario
    - Prefer education
    - Contribute to the upstream Security Guide
        - Collaborate with @fungi
    - Link to it from blog or SCS docs
