## Topics

### Security in SCS (@bitkeks, ~10mins)

- Security pipeline (@90n20)
    - https://zuul.scs.community/t/SCS/job/scs-daily-security-scan
    - ZAP Blockers: [Feat/zap baseline scan + minor fixes PR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/pull/2) has been merged. Need to wait until daily pipeline trigger to check if everything works as expected and scan results get pushed into DefectDojo instance (works as expected on testing environment)
        - Can pipeline be triggered manually?
    - Greenbone CE Blockers: Deployment of Greenbone CE containers architecture in Zuul worker nodes during pipeline trigger has been achieved. 
        - Main problems:
            - Deploy architecture with docker-compose instead of community.docker.docker_compose_v2 ansible module. Community collections are not available on Zuul, so docker-compose was installed changing ensure-docker role configuration (Build time in worker around 30-40 mins)
                - AI: @o-otte will look into this -> [issue#625](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/625)
            - Expose gmvd unix socket (from its respective container) to the worker node without affecting other containers functionality.
            - A delay on the pipeline has been added to get everything bootstraped. Initial tests failed because the socket was not being created before being called from scripts. 
        - Other minor problems: permissions, installation of gvm-tools (and python-gmv library), communication using gvm-cli for debugging...among others.
        - Next step: Test and implement scanning python script
- Adding security into SCS docs, https://docs.scs.community/docs (@bitkeks)
    - Most probably under "Ops", document the security scanner pipeline as an operations tool
- Next steps in security assessment
    - Container layer - Main idea is to create a pipeline within SCS Zuul, in the same way as done in IaaS layer, to deploy trivy and scan the container layer implementation.
- Info: Security hardening in IaaS observability in k3s showed some challenges in Kubernetes TLS-by-default settings (by @matofeder)
    - See [issues/495#issuecomment-2077217532](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/495#issuecomment-2077217532)
- Info: Security hardening standard "Kubernetes cluster hardening standard" received an update (by @hannes.baum)
    - Open for reviews: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/581


### Security scope discussion
- Above sec pipeline does security scanning of live environments, could be amended by build-time dependencies and their security status with [OWASP DependencyTrack](https://dependencytrack.org) - SBOMs
    - Security pipeline is currently aimed at DAST to enable automatic pentesting of SCS infrastructure
    - SAST is in focus for later work, see Trivy in Harbor. DependencyTrack can also be implemented in build pipelines

SAST = Static Application Security Testing
DAST = Dynamic ...

### IAM

#### Example documentation
* [#190](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/190)
* [MR to ansible-playbooks](https://github.com/osism/ansible-playbooks/pull/403)
    * Need ansible knowledge here
    * osism PR pending, as JuanPTM fails to create the correct flow - @JuanPTM to report this in the issue/PR

#### Use cases scenarios for federation

#### Roles only set on first login [#360](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/360)
* Blueprint should contain proposal
* https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystoneauth/+spec/roles-only-set-on-first-login
    * One role mapping for the proxy realm (general, for all)
    * Need role assignment from IdP (https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone-specs/+/748748) from Rafael
        * Artem has suggestions to improve API (not appreciated by [Rafael Weingartner](https://review.opendev.org/q/owner:rafael%2540apache.org))
        * Implementation exists (but outdated)
        * Needs decision - but no discussion in keystone spec
            * Opinions needed
        * AI @garloff: Setup meeting w/ Rafael, ...
    * User Attributes should define role assignments
        * Construct json in keycloak for keystone
        * Claims: User `X` is `member` in project `Y`
        * Can custom keycloak mappers generate the json or do we need custom java/quarkus code?
            * https://www.keycloak.org/docs-api/23.0.6/javadocs/org/keycloak/protocol/saml/mappers/ScriptBasedMapper.html (Example is SAML, may benefit from something like this for OIDC)
            * Update: JS is deprecated, would need to develop Java code. Many examples exist, no big deal. Need to deploy JAR though.
* Needs spec

#### Architecture of Federated IAM
* https://input.scs.community/C6OKMb4xQQuqnHC6axv08g#
* Who has control over domains, projects, groups, users, roles?
* Groups in keycloak can not easily be assigned roles ...
    * Would need to feed group role assignments as they are set by creating keystone roles ("pre-provisioning")
    * Other option: custom mapper evaluates group role assignments when generating project_json
* Trouble: keycloak does not know about the existing projects of the realm/domain
    * Could create groups `member_projectX`, `reader_projectX`, `manager_projectX` 
* Trouble: user attributes are simple key-value pairs
    * Custom json is error-prone
* Proxy realm needs to ensure that we know the real realm (=> domain) - security feature
* VexxHost approach: Keycloak backend https://github.com/vexxhost/keystone-keycloak-backend/tree/main
    * Cuts out OIDC between local keycloak and keystone
        * avoid complexity and getting out of sync?
        * but not having the auth flow?
    * Where are projects managed?
        * keystone -- keycloak does not have a notion of projects
* General problem: keycloak does not have a notion of projects
    * ... but we could maybe abuse users/groups/roles to model projects (with specific naming convention / settings / ...)
    * similar idea in https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0301-v1-naming-conventions.md
* Development environment for keycloak
    * https://docs.scs.community/docs/iaas/guides/other-guides/testbed
