## Agenda

### gx-scs currently completely broken / out of capacity
- Completely breaks zuul (no single VM can be created, k8s cluster affected)
- @gtema will talk to PS w.r.t. migration to scs2

### IAM ToDos
* Documentation of limitations
* See [Federation v2 document](https://input.scs.community/scs-federation#)
* How to capture ideas and designs for overcoming some of them?
    * Write up on hedgedoc
    * Publish:
        * Blog-Post (@gtema)
        * SuperUser article?
    * What else?

### Security pipelines progress
* Progress
  * Working with @gtema in issue [#21](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/issues/21) in order to solve scanning results not being uploaded to defectdojo. [PR #23](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/pull/23) should solve this, however last daily run did not complete as it seems that Zuul workers are having problems in all pipes right now (NODE_FAILURE).
  * Issue [#15](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/issues/15) seems to be solved with PRs [#10](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/pull/10) and [#13](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/pull/13). We are monitoring that no more errors spawn before closing it.
  * With the fix introduced in [PR #20](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/pull/20), issue [14](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/issues/14) has been closed.
* Anything open?
    * Nothing
    * Doc review and report review @garloff (may lead to some questions)
* [Greenbone Enterprise](https://www.greenbone.net/en/testnow/) wanted?
    * Lots of Enterprise features, could be very useful to CSPs
    * Only a few days for validating whether they fit into our pipelines, so we could make this option visible to CSPs
        * We can't include them of course, we only ship free software
    * Check will be done by looking at the documentation (@90n20)
