## Agenda

### Security scanning (@spectertj)

- The pipeline has been adapted to store all scanner and operator reports in an "Object Storage", only a few tests remain
- Documentation for this both Operator is done
- Can be published to dedicated container/bucket near the zuul logs
    - Problem for non-Zuul services (like Kubernetes Trivy Operator): Swift/radosgw does not allow app credential separation. Can be solved by creating dedicated OpenStack projects for each use case
        - May be not a problem for current config: theres a Zuul pipeline that fetches the Trivy Operator logs and pushes them to S3
    - different "artifacts" have different "expiration"
    - Expiration of files should be handled by object storage service itself by setting expiration metadata on the object
- AI: Config for SCS S3 object storage date
    - Use WaveStack object storage? - radowgw does not support ACL in depth
    - Needs separate credentials. Fetch from Vault?
    - We set artifact expiration to seven days
- Proposal: Create a small export application for Trivy Operator, which can also handle Vault credential fetching
