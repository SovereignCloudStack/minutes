### Backlog Refinement

#### Analyzing the "Doing" lane
* The (meta) epic issue#25 contains issue#191 as list item
    * issue#191 is also labeled as epic, which is confusing.
    * @fkr proposes that stories should be achievable within 2 weeks. Otherwise they should be labeled as an epic.
* The (meta) epic issue#25 contains various list items that have not been created as user story
    * @reqa states that only one item currently can be worked on. 
    * @reqa proposes to close the mod_oauth2 story as it's now upstream.
* We need proper TLS certificates to be able to proceed with issue#191
* @reqa proposes to first answer all architectual questions before we proceed with automating/integrating an IdP in our reference implementation, e.g. where IdP will be deployed (IaaS-layer, KaaS-layer) onto?

#### Aim of todays meeting is to prioritize the currently open stories and epics.
Project Board: https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/27

* @fkr proposes to create an user story for moving Keycloak onto the Kubernetes-powered runtime

* issue#254 (ADR for the required IdP features needed): https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/254
