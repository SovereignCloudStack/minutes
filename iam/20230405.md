## Agenda
* OpenStack - PTG / Reviewathon
    * Will probably only happen again in the week after easter - waiting for final review+merge of patch for Device Authorization grant
* Looking into `mod_oauth2` compatibility with Keystone based on Ubuntu 22.04
* Zitadel:
    * we have a custom claim `openstack-default-project` in the`access_token` now, injected by means of a Zitadel "Action" script
    * WebSSO-Login to Horizon works with that
    * CLI login not successful yet, as Zitadel doesn implement `Resource Owner Credentials Grant` (`v3oidcpassword` in OpenStack lingo, aka username/password) because it's deprecated in OAuth 2.1
    * further CLI testing with Zitadel blocked until Zitadel ships a version with `Device Authorization Grant`
* SCS-IAM-Minihackathon:
    * https://input.scs.community/2023-scs-iam-minihackathon
    * Local Train/tram route from main station to direction University (Line 6) is in service again - no problems there. Exit at "Berufsbildungswerk", use maps to walk to the offices from there.
