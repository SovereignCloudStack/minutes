### Domain Manager Standard (@markus-hentsch)

PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/343

Test implementation:

- test suite has been added under Tests/iam/domain-manager/
    - see https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/343/files
    - around 60 tests, includes security-focused negative tests

Role assignments by Domain Manager:

- current state
    - "member" is the one and only role that a Domain Manager might assign/revoke within a domain strictly defined in the standard
- questions:
    1. should the standard allow to select a different role and/or define multiple eligible roles? (permitting the modification of the policy configuration to adjust the role(s) specific to the CSP)
    2. should a Domain Manager be able to assign/revoke the domain-manager role to/from other users within the domain?
- consensus from today's IaaS call:
    - we should introduce flexibility into the standard, allowing the CSP to define the roles that a domain manager should be able to manage
        - the standard should only prohibit adding the 'admin' role there
- any opposing opinions?
