## Agenda
### Sprint review Jena, planning Kyoto
* [Taskboard](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/27)

### Testbed vs CiaB vs Production Config repo input (cookiecutter, defaults)
* Each concrete setup has its own separate config repository, created with osism's cookiecutter
    * This is were settings, overrides, ... are done
    * Defaults from https://github.com/osism/cfg-cookiecutter, https://github.com/osism/cfg-generics, https://github.com/osism/defaults
    * Testbed and Cloud-in-a-Box (CiaB) are simply config-repositories for these use-cases
    * No commit to testbed or ciab repo automatically hits any of the others
    * No process to systematically port changes between those either
        * Improvements pending: A-B-C approach (for TSI)
            * Ansible-config will be possible in the future in OSISM's defaults repo
            * Currently only possible for ansible .ini style settings
            * Blog post to be written ..., SuperUser article ...
            * This will help testbed experience to more closely resemble prod env from an operator(!) perspective, longterm testbeds supported by manager-less setup, zuul jobs can do maintenance on testbeds ...
    * Changes to prod repos:
        * Defaults for new installs may be changed in above 3 repos ([cookiecutter](https://github.com/osism/cfg-cookiecutter), [cfg-generics](https://github.com/osism/cfg-cookiecutter), [defaults](https://github.com/osism/defaults))
        * For existing customer deployments, it may need documentation (as customers may need to change settings in their own config repo)
* IAM team: Plan?
    * Adjusted Keystone templates need to fo to cfg-cookiecutter
    * We will probably set `enable_keystone_federation: "no"` in the osism/defaults repo and document how to configure & enable it (operation docs)
    * Once done we can add a note to the release notes (and in the "Upgrade notes" section there)
    * Need to find out how to include https://github.com/sventorben/keycloak-home-idp-discovery and deploy that into the Keycloak container
    * Topics to address:
        * keystone settings
        * corresponding keycloak settings
        * documentation how to enable federation and limitations ("technical preview")
    * R5-RC (2023-09-07) goals:
        * Proxy realm won't make it
        * Templates for keystone config + keycloak settings: Can be done (before EOB)
        * Multi-group support out of scope for R5
            * Resolve questions around mapping engine before ...
    * R5 final (2023-09-20)
        * We may be able to take more improvements after RC than usual, as these are disabled by default and thus have little risk to break anything

### IAM documentation overhaul
* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/72
* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/pull/728
Please review!
* Documentation of identity federation in SCS:
    * [#397](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/397)

### Reporting potentially sensitive issues (security, ...)
* All (>80) members in SCS github org have the base permission write for github SovereignCloudStack org
    * Allows to create branches, commit to them, see all issues, do reviews, ...
    * Don't want to change
* Desire:
    * Issues that can only be seen by reporter, assignees (SCS PO / CPO / ...), and invited people
        * Make it easy to invite additional people as needed 
    * Ideally with the ability to make it public later on
    * Do github issues support that (with our free tier access model)?
        * Not available? Only gitlab supports this?
        * https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories
    * osism
        * Non-public repos, github-manager-private
        * Teams in org are assigned to github repos
        * Access-control only possible per repo, not per issue
    * Launchpad
        * Has per issue controls
* AI @90n20: Research and come up with proposal

### Progress on issues
* Research into the handling of OpenStack domains when mapping users from the Keycloak proxy realm
    * Feedback from SIG-IAM and Kristi Nikolla:  https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/314#issuecomment-1707992955
        * All ephemeral users end up in proxying domain :-(
        * Mapping engine extension underway, *may* resolve the limitation
    * Wavecon decided to implement external provisioning tooling that creates `local` type OpenStack shadow accounts instead of using `ephemeral` type accounts. But that requires additional "wiring" between the IdP and the provisioning tooling to trigger it on login.
        * Syncing users is hard to do in a reliable way

* UBI image for keycloak
    * [EULA license agreement](https://www.redhat.com/licenses/EULA_Red_Hat_Universal_Base_Image_English_20190422.pdf) confirmation needed (by Operator?)
