## Agenda

### Security pipelines progress
- Scanning Results: Failures related to Zuul workers (`NODE_FAILURE`) are still in place. Last daily run (27.11.2024 03:00) failed during nuclei defectdojo upload task. This is under investigation. https://zuul.sovereignit.cloud/t/scs/build/81aee4ffb9a740aea373c6e7919af250. Just saying `FAILURE`, may be an issue with the worker. Issue to track this:
- [PR #16](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/pull/16) related to documentation improvements still needs review by @garloff.
    - Will clarify term "operator" @90n20
- Greenbone Enterprise: Provided as an appliance or as a Cloud Service. There are currently no official Docker containers available, hence the provided scanning pipelines would not work with an Enterprise Solution out of the box. Maybe consult with Greenbone directly about this?
    - AI @garloff: Will respond to Elmar Geese (Cc @90n20)
    - The API support in the enterprise edition could be useful to Operators
- Security service EOF
    - @90n20 will continue to be part of the community and is willing to continue looking at keeping things working (with limited time obviously)
