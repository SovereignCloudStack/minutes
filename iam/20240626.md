## Agenda

### Security (Report by @bitkeks)
* David:
    * Document Infra pipeline repo under https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/tree/main/docs
    * Create the deployment scripts for a full functional standalone defect dojo instance => https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/defectdojo/tree/feat/initial-deployment-scripts
        - Terraform and ansible scripts are ready. The deployment is based on roles in a similar way as the SCS zuul deployment repo. 
        - Readme was updated with instructions to deploy everything.
          Will create a PR today for merge it into main
            Â¿Explain this in [#537](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/537)?

* We need to be *really* careful to not leak secrets via logs
    * Both zuul and github
    * The job creator is responsible to ensure being careful here
    * Report upload (with token) also carries the risk of leaking secrets
        * Secret handling approach wanted: Where to store them and how to define policies (rotation)

* Antonio: 
    * Create a  CaaS scan pipeline
        -  Initial Trivy playbook scripts have been added to https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-k8s-scan-pipeline/tree/feat/initial-pipeline-setup
        -  Next step -> create the zuul config for running this daily and the defectdojo exporters.
        -  Scanning jobs using trivy operator will be added. Trivy operator needs to be installed on the cluster in advance, so we are figuring out if install it using helm during the pipeline pre-run or just provide instructions on the repo to let operators know this is a requirement (which makes more sense). By the default, operator scans the cluster after installation, after each time a resource changes and every 24 hours (this could be modified via "OPERATOR_SCANNER_REPORT_TTL" variable)
        -  As an alternative, we are studying the use of proposed https://github.com/telekom-mms/trivy-dojo-report-operator tool, which theoretically allows to automatically export trivy operator reports to defectdojo by "listening" to changes on them in the cluster. This will save processing time on SCS Zuul, make everything cluster dependant. Antonio is installing and configuring everything needed on a test environment.
        - If this works, maybe it could be a good idea to translate this to the k8s team to see if its possible to include trivy operator during CaaS deployments by default, simplifying the requirements needs.
            - To discuss: Where will the credentials be stored? Will the container team also benefit from centralized secret management?
        - Updates will be reported in [#659](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/659) and [#669](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/669)

### IAM / Federation

- Import CA into Keycloak [isssue#597](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/597)
    - [Ansible-collection MR](https://github.com/osism/ansible-collection-services/pull/1480)
        - Review requested (@garloff)
        - Running on k8s (k3s) -- would also allow for HA setup for keycloak
            - Side discussion: k3s is a multi-node production ready solution (ensure not to use sqlite3)
        - @artificial-intelligence: Container team reviews wanted for #1480
    - [testbed MR](https://github.com/osism/testbed/pull/2261)

- Migrate container build to Zuul (AI @JuanPTM)
    - [PR zuul-config#37](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/zuul-config/pull/37)
    - @o-otte to implement, @gtema offers support

### Roles

- State unchanged
- keystone meeting happening today
- keystone in need of core reviewers
