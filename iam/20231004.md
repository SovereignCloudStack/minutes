* Minutes transfer: Add to minutes repo (directory iam) and open PR (with ~two other participants as reviewers)

### Vulnerability findings reporting process
* Need to explain to community (comm. call) how we handle security findings via [github advisories](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/security/advisories)
    * Why?
    * Process description
    * AI @garloff to ask @seykotron, @90n20 to prepare this
* Clarification: Pentesting in IAM team?

### Progress report
* domain manager standard update
    * [Standard draft](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/343) is mostly complete
        * CSPs may have different approaches
        * CSPs may have different roles / schemes / naming
        * Tests are implemented
        * Can we make this stronger and have a recommendation for roles and role naming? (With the goal to have mandatory at some point in the future.)
            * reader, member, (project-)manager, domain-manager
            * Need input from CSPs
            * => This will go into a 2nd standard
        * Please review! CSP feedback from aov, artcodix wanted
        * Goal: Merge this in cwk41
* working on [#405](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/405)
    * Progress upstream, patch on [gerrit](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone/+/896072)
    * Only 3 tests failing
    * Debugging work ongoing
    * python-linter complains (function too complex, b/c of one added line :-O)
* working on [#314](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/314)
    * Installation of IdP discovery pluging on the testbed deployment [PR 1775](https://github.com/osism/testbed/pull/1775).
    * @berendt : Create a custom Keycloak image
        * Who should do it? 
        * Where do we store it?
        * Upgrade Keycloak?
    * IdP discovery configuration
    * Lower priority than #405
    * Discussion: Have one repo per image or one repo with all overlays?
        * https://github.com/osism/container-images
            * Need to create a container-images repo in SCS org
            * @garloff to create repo (add to github-manager), enable in zuul (@o-otte), add harbor robot secrets (think about namespaces: @garloff with @jschoone / dNation), @berendt to help with plugging, enabling renovate, @JuanPTM to create keycloak overlay there
                * ToDo: Check github-manager's ability to create repos (@garloff)
                * ToDo: Merge upstream (osism) github-manager code (@berendt, @garloff)
        * renovate or daily rebuilds of overlays are possible
    
* Support [#650](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/650) 
    * Not much success
    * Custom client (which we don't know)
        * Our client works, AI @JuanPTM to share our config that works
    * Waiting for more user info
        * AI @berendt to ping @killermoehre to give status update, try to define focus time when this can be worked on with priority (as opposed to one step every other week)
    * AI @garloff, @jschoone, @fkr: Support process documentation (answering the question: how does SCS together with integration partners deliver enterprise support?)
