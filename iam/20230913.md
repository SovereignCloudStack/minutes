#### Finalizing IAM highlights for R5
* [Highlights doc](https://input.scs.community/2023-scs-r5-highlights-collection#)
    * What is the top one (or are the top two) highlight(s) from IAM point of view? (To be considered for the press release.)
    * Contributing to what [outcomes](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/pull/662)?
    * A few more words in each bullet would help for the release notes.
#### IAM docs and blogs
* IAM design doc
    * Issue [#397](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/397): [Docs PR#72](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/72)
    * Blog post OpenStack CLI & Dev Authz Grant PKCE: [website PR #728](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/pull/728)
    * Reviews wanted!
#### Issue reporting
* Research from Minery on best way to reporting sec issues privately in some ticket system (ideally github)
    * See [last week](https://input.scs.community/#Reporting-potentially-sensitive-issues-security-%E2%80%A6) for requirements
    * Proposal: use GitHub ["repository security advisories"](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories)
        * Only visible to reporter, assigned members and mantainers/administrators
        * Can be discussed privately (including a fork to add changes) and then closed or made public
        * Researchers/reporters/collaborators can be "credited" for their findings
        * Additional advanatage: GitHub is a CNA and can issue CVEs. Moreover, published advisories could be reviewed by Github to send alerts to other affected repositories. 
        * Drawbacks: Once published, they can only be removed by contacting GitHub support.
    * Urgent things can always go to [security@scs.community](mailto:security@scs.community) as documented on <https://scs.community/.well-known/security.txt>
        * Some things already discusseed in every friday meeting with @garloff
        * One example: exposed ports on testbed external interface (debug endpoints, information leak, limited DoS) due to the kubelet agent health port binded to other interfaces than loopback (127.0.0.1). Related to [CVE-2019-11248](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11248); will get announced shortly via that email channel

#### Issue [issues/#184](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/184) (Domain Manager) (@markus-hentsch)

- current work (policy file adjustments) put into a standard draft
    - <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/commit/6536313688e593a5aabc58fb1eff3000751826b7>
    - no PR yet (contents still WIP, no testing script yet)
- testing script is to be implemented
    - testing requires pre-configuration by admin user (creation of domains, domain manager users etc.)
    - idea: script as admin and user mode
        - admin mode: creates domain, users etc. itself and tests it
        - user mode: requires provider admin to prepare test domain, test users etc. beforehand and provide input credentials
