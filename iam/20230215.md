## Agenda

### Sprint Review & Planning

* https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/27

* IdP requirements from container layer: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/194
  - Focus area!
  - Workshop required: Needed views:
    * Application deployers/DevOps  (deploying services/workloads on a managed k8s)
    * Experts understanding the available mechanisms in k8s (and the broader CNCF universe) to possibly fulfill the DevOps needs
  - Write down as user stories: Who wants to achieve what, expecting what behavior?
  - See also https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/163
  - AI @garloff (@jschoone) to set this up - possibly SIG IAM 2022-02-22 or Overflow 2022-02-27, possibly follow up @ Hackathon

* ADR writing ID broker requirements: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/254
  * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/205
  * Good research, good requirements, no decision
  * Zitadel does not support LDAP, is that a problem?
    - Is direct access to backend identities needed?
    - Probably not ...
      - But LDAP can also be used for the local "POSIX" accounts of admins (NSS/PAM), Operators might love to reuse the IAM backend use the same technology for this??? -> Not relevant for SCS
    - Not relevant for users, they need to use OIDC (or SAML) to federate. Period.
  * Device auth grant missing from zitadel
    - planned
  * PR standards/#205 needs finalization, request to provide feedback via community-call, mail (done @reqa 2023-02-08), followup mail (AI @fkr)

* Docs for federated auth: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/160
  - Two parts: 
    - (1) Architecture: Done, updating, see PR https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/208
    - (2) HowTo for our Ref.Impl.: To be done (after we have decided on the implementation choices)
      -> split out, needs new user story (AI @reqa, later), docs/operational-docs/

* Federated identities for OpenStack https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/191
  * Upstream review (Kristi) ongoing

* IdP deployment at infra layer will move from ansible/docker to infra-kubernetes (possibly k3s)
  * IaaS team: k3s cluster at management plane not yet ready

* Test with Zitadel
  * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/260
  * Fighting with connections


### Overflow

#### Re-cap of call with Kristi Nikolla
* Keystone tokens
  - service with scoped tokens has no idea about project?
* Impedance mismatch b/w oauth tokens and scoped RBAC in keystone
* Vision: Get rid of keystone tokens and directly validate oauth tokens from all services in a performant way
* Domain Manager role in OpenStack in 2024 is very ambitious?
* Upcoming PTG:
  - Discuss Manager role there
  - RBAC discussions

### Housekeeping
* Reschedule to 11:35, as noone expects the Spanish Inq^W 11:30. (AI @fkr)
* Need to start putting more focus on k8s IAM
