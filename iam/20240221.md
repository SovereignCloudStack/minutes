## Recurring items & housekeeping
* Minutes transfer: @reqa
* Community call reporting: @JuanPTM

## Agenda

### IAM

#### Container building [#509](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/509)
* Completed (last week)
* Followup work: Automation to keep image it up-to-date?
    * Currently github action
    * Manual PR needed
    * dependabot / renovate desirable
    * -> new user story (AI @reqa)

#### Keycloak deployment on k3s
* The IP for `keycloak.testbed.osism.xyz` changed to `192.168.16.100` (metalLB in front of k8s service)
* Keycloak available under https://keycloak.testbed.osism.xyz/auth (via sshuttle)
    * Should be added to homer, so it's found
    * After `osism apply keycloak` and `osism apply keycloak-oidc-client-configuration` (to be unified in one role in the future, PR to be done by @reqa)
    * ... as documented in https://docs.scs.community/docs/iam
* TODO:
    * Some janitorial work ahead
        * e.g. testbed: https://github.com/osism/testbed/commit/95d0f660135ecf213761e1bb9ab9a71144433a23#diff-74f457c051e484cfc3500d1c26b90fed708bddfb1a327d8130b4bb8f12da4d7c added `keystone_container_federation_oidc_client_secret` which is also in the keystone role and needs to be in sync
    * Documentation: How shall prod deployments handle things like that ^^
    * Release notes
        * Mentioning that this replaces the old keycloak version and integration (and ask for contacting us with migration desires)

#### Keystone (@JuanPTM)
* Allow assignment of domain specific role to federated users:
  - [gerrit MR](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone/+/907121) - may need one more +1?
* Move roles into keystone token (like groups)?
  - Upstream discussion (w/ @gtema) seems useful
* [Issue #360](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/409) 
  - [Doc PR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/138) documenting the limitation of roles not being updated for ephemeral users
      - Needs review

#### Roles discussion
* In team IaaS on 2024-02-21 (@josephinesei, @reqa)
    * Probably we'll need to extend the Keystone engine (described in [mapping_combinations](https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/admin/federation/mapping_combinations.html#auto-provisioning)) to support roles with the `domain` keyword (for the `local` part of the mapping).
    * Upstream "Secure RBAC" work is happening
        * Our work fits in there (domain manager => "persona manager in domain-scope")
        * We want to drive this as upstream progress is slow
            * Service roles are not enabled in all projects yet
            * Watch out for security implications!
        * "One scope per token" -> needs more understanding
            * Scopes: system, domain, project (not clear supersets of each other :-( )
            * Roles: admin > manager > member > reader
            * Followup discussion @reqa, @josephinesei desirable
    * Upstream Status: https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/rbac-goal-tracking#L48
    * Status Summary/Overview: https://input.scs.community/wC2dBXkbQjmTGS3JgVyDLA#
* Bug: domain listing visible for all domain managers:
    * https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone/+/900028

### Sec/Pentesting

- @90n20 and @bitkeks reviewed the IaaS security assessment process and results
    - Assessment sheets were filtered mostly for Lynis, because it produces similar results to OpenSCAP, but OpenSCAP was more useful
    - LinPEAS produces thousands of results but only a handful is useful for this assessment - filtered as well
    - The IaaS recommendations need now to be evaluated together with OSISM
    - Maybe the results can also be used as rules in Nuclei in the security pipeline
- The results for "IaaS external pentesting" (https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/409) were originally discussed via Github Security Advisories. Since these do not provide sufficient persistence, the results will also be put into Nextcloud as PDF
- Pentesting from internal VM ([#530](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/530)) almost finished. No security problems have been found. Results to be uplodaded into Nexctloud.
- Working on Greenbone CE implementation into the automated pentesting pipeline.
    - Persistence for volumes for Docker compose architecture is currently WIP
    - Contact to Greenbone (Elmar Geese) can be established via OSBA (ask @garloff or @bitkeks)
    -> David sends email to Kurt/Dominik with topics and we relay, aiming for collaboration
- Open implementation security assessment epics that can be continued on:
    - Container implementation: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/393 
        - We wait for R6 for this to begin
        - Container-centric tools will be used, e.g. Kubehunter
    - Ops tooling implementation: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/395
- Credentials in Git
    - Please review your commits and history regarding accidentally commited secrets and credentials
    - Zuul repo had some credentials, were deactivated and gitleak pre-hook was added
    - Terraform repos should also review their `.tfstate` files. Are they needed?
        - These should NEVER be in git (even if no secrets are in it). Add it to `.gitignore`.
        - If Terraform state needs to be shared there are better tools: terraform has a way to keep a remote .tfstate (so it can be shared without a central admin VM)
