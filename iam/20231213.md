### Domain Manager / Role Standard (@markus-hentsch)

- domain manager compatibility with Horizon and Terraform ([#383](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/383))
    - new fixes implemented, testing WIP by @berendt
- domain manager role proposed upstream ([#384](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/384))
    - bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/2045974
    - spec: https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone-specs/+/903172
- role standard ([#396](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/396))
    - draft written but stuck, see [comment here](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/396#issuecomment-1852491416)
    - policy defaults and settings are very complicated, hard to define a consistent and working standard for all services (while keeping domain manager compatibility)
    - needs more research and testing, see the github issue above for details
