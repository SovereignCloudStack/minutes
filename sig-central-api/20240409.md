### Preparation of Hackathon Session

- [Hackathon Pad](https://input.scs.community/Hy0HqULMTGeeVIcy0vmBgA#ROOM-2---Central-API-bitkeks):
    - Hackthon next Week
- Plan for the Session:
    - Setting up a Testbed
    - Setting up Kubernetes Cluster and installing Central API MVP
    - Simulate an Endcustomer to deploy OpenStack resources
    - For Cluster Stacks: Should ClusterAPI be accessible or only Central API Crossplane CRs?
    - Proposal: Abstract Cluster API with XRD, use that in the future to also abstract Gardener
