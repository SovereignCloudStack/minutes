## Agenda

### Central API Scope and Personas

- Draft: https://input.scs.community/scs-sig-central-api-scope

- Big Question: How to work with Providers who only provides a subset of SCS Services (E.g. only IaaS and no KaaS)
- Should focus on how to build the Central API. Certification aspects should be discussed in SIG Standards
- Input from IaaS Providers on thoughts on Central API would be nice


### Gardener (Not discussed)

- In Ops call on 2024-02-15 Ralf mentioned, that PS will deploy a k8s-compliant Gardener installation.
    - Is this relevant for Central API?
