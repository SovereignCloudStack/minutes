## Agenda

- Central API at Gonicus Hackathon in April (@bitkeks)
    - Hacking session towards R7
    - @bitkeks plans session in "official program"
    - We will discuss the scope in regards to small CSPs and bigger CSPs - where is the common ground?
- Current technology state of proposal
    - Question 1: How is Cluster Stacks integrated in Central API? Do we want to offer both APIs? Or abstract CS in Central API?
        - Abstracting it would solve issues with RBAC (could be difficult to unify both interfaces)
    - Question 2: What about XRDs towards Gardener?
        - Still open for discussion
    - Question 3: SDKs? Python/Go libraries?
- plusserver: Billing, different teams for backend systems
    - Deploying Central API with customer permissions is okay, with privileged permissions not
    - What about systems that are not in PCO? VMware, etc. -> scope of Central API focussed on SCS-components (standardised implementations)
- Looking forward, Central API is aligned to GAIA-X in regards to service catalogues
    - Must be considered in SCS Managed Services
    - Central API would need to expose all CSP services (all layers) towards GAIA-X
