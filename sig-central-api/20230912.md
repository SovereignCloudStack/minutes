## Agenda

### Current work on the central API

* Mirroring of crossplane cluster scoped resources to crossplane "tenant API"
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/central-api

### Further discussion on the integration of the KaaS Ref.-Impl.

* First question is if ClusterStacks are Kubernetes Ressources
    * There is an Operator and CRDs and ClusterStack is also one of them
    * CRDs are namespaced, Secrets, e.g. for OpenStack Provider, are stored in the namespace
    * Ref.-Implementation can be used in the Multitenancy Management Cluster and is intended this way
* Announced PoC is delayed due to some problems -> Will be announced in the matrix rooms for Team Container and SIG Central API

* Question on how to integrate both solutions
    * How should it be used by a CSP?
    * Central API should be a tool for the CSPs to complement their offering to managed everything
    * Question if the Central API is mandatory -> Question for SIG standardization ?
    * Right now the API has three parts (intended with different controllers): 
        1. OpenStack -> Crossplane
        2. Kubernetes Clusters -> Cluster Stacks
        3. IAM
