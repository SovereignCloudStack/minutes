## Agenda

### Frontend view? (@fkr)

- @fkr had a discussion with @mauhau from UhuruTec regarding their work on a frontend that sits in front of yaook/openstack/kubernetes and we wondered whether this would be a good way to approach 'a unified frontend for the SCS stack'.

Discussion in meeting:

- short presentation of UhuruTec frontend and architecture
- backend translating UI calls to actual OpenStack calls is present, but was short-cutted in the demo setup

### Deployment of shared central API instance

- Anything that works, for now. TF/Ansible (or K8s atop etc.)
