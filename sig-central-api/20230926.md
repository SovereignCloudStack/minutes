## Agenda

### Discussion on how to integrate IAM with central API

* First idea, having a Kubernetes controller talking to Keycloak in which we want to manage Tenants and Federations
* Keycloak federation enabled with keystone and other IdP are currently work in progress by OSISM, which can be leveraged
* Using SCS UCS as an IdP as it's already used for Harbor and uses OIDC.
* Use a [long-term Kubernetes](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/435) as "eat your own dogfood"
    * Team Container will setup the cluster
* Test out Tenant Separation of Central API in the SCS community context

### Lightning talk about Kamaji

* Jan talked to the maintainers
* They want to present it in the community call as a lightning talk
* Could be a good application for the Central API
* @joshmue already took a look
    * It might cost something as nodes are needed
* Lightning talk is appreciated

### Crossplane namespaced Resources support

* There is an upstream project to generate namespaced resources
* This can be used instead of our own implementation to generate those in the future

## Cluster Stacks Demo

* We should try out the Demo and report issues and experiences
    * @joshmue will try it
