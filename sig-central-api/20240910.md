## Agenda

### Integrate applications into Central API

* Can we move forward to also integrate APIs for IAM?
    * Keycloak provider is available
    * Example User: https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/crossplane-contrib/provider-keycloak/v1.4.0/resources/user.keycloak.crossplane.io/User/v1alpha1
* Testing and deployment - open, maybe after release
    * Release notes ready
* EOF feedback
    * "How is rate limiting implemented?" -> look into. 
    * We do not handle backend resource limits (quotas) in Central API -> focus on error handling
* Progressing Central API
    * Extending the Kubernetes XRDs for more fields
    * Q: How do we handle the flavors for nodes? -> Flavors are SCS standards, therefore it does not matter which IaaS is running. Using the flavor defines the user's request for resources
        * Alternatively we can switch to multiple fields (vcores, RAM, GPU true/false) in the XRD and then discover the correct flavor in the backend
        * User-given requirements are "low end", e.g. "my worker should have 1,5GB RAM" -> flavor with 2GB
