## Agenda

### Gardener backend demonstration (@joshmue, @mxmxchere)

* [Central API, POC] Create "SCS Cluster" XRD with composites for ClusterAPI "Clusters" and Gardener Shoots: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/608
    * Status of PoC? -> Demo by joshua
    * Customer only uses "kind: Cluster" with "spec: version" and thats all. Backend is chosen by composite as deployed by CSP
* PR: Reorganize, add XRD and Gardener files https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/central-api/pull/13
    * Unify code from hackathon and from Gardener PoC into one cleaned up code base
    * Do the two compositions come into conflict in using the `composite resource`? Could be, but not in practice since CSPs will have only one backend (Cluster API or Gardener)
* Update documentation
    * Update `docs/` folder so it is integrated into docs.scs.community

### Hacking Session
- Start on implementing ClusterAPI related resources
    - Success on the CAPI variant
- Next steps would be defining the user facing API. Could/should this be placed in SIG standardization?
