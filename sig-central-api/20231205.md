## Agenda

### discussion of the status quo

### Keycloak integration

Where to use what for?

### Comparison to StackIT API's, ClusterStacks etc.

- Tradeoffs between abstraction etc.

Working basis: Do not try to abstract much more

### How to deploy?

Probably use CAPI bootstrapping:

1. Create kind cluster
2. Install CAPI in kind cluster
3. Create soon-to-be mgmt cluster with CAPI
4. CAPI move to now-to-be mgmt cluster
5. Create central API cluster via mgmt cluster

Create one or more sketches for installation which provide a overview about:
- the steps in the lifecycle
- different usage/deployment scenarios
- interactions/activities with internal APIs

-> It is probably good idea to define/express the terminology to simplify the understanding and discussion
