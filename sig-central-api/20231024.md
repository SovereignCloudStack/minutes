## Agenda

### Current Development

- Wait on IAM Documentation from OSISM
- May want a better overview whats already done
    - OpenStack Implementation not well documented in the issue, but basically done
    - Integration of Cluster Stacks should be done on the persistant cluster. But would should go on that cluster?
    - Were should run how many instances of Central API, Cluster API, etc.?
        - KaaS can by deployed by anyone (CSP + customers)
        - First approach was that CSPs host those APIs for themselves (decentralized), tenant separation by namespaces. Persistent cluster would be a management cluster
        - When deploying the management cluster, KaaS and Central API should get deployed in there automatically
    - IAM management would need another controller and CRDs, or KeyCloak Crossplane Provider?

### Topics for the Hackathon

- Long term Cluster and Central API
    - Idea for cluster was that we are able to manage it

- Getting Cluster Stacks and Central API together
    - Deployment of CRDs, Controllers, etc. how Credentials are getting into the namespaces, were to put them. Bootstrapping 
- Defining an opinionated workflow for onboarding?
- Role/Access Management in central API
- Getting opinions from CSPs & Users of KaaS what they want to see on a central API
