## Agenda

### Recap on what happend the last two weeks

- On xpkg branch, there is a build and package script for the crossplane configuration
    - uses nix for development environment
    - needs some bootstrapping (local cluster needed for crossplane)
- Push to registry: https://registry.scs.community/harbor/projects/36/repositories
- Service Provider only needs to install Crossplane and the Configurations provided by SCS Harbor
- Decision: should we bundle the definitions for all backends into one xpkg or do we split them?
    - Bundle: everything will be in one package, even if the CSP does not need it
    - Split: multiple xpkgs need to be built, but can be separatly installed
    - --> We split the xpkgs
- Demonstration with blank KinD cluster: Install Crossplane and apply crossplane.io for configuration, pulling the artifact from registry
    - Result: all CRDs for OpenStack resources are installed, in api.scs.community API group
- AI @joshmue: Deployment refactoring, looking at CI/CD build pipeline
