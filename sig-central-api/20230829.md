## Agenda

### Mission Statement for the SIG (Draft)

* For defining a common and central interface for the Customers of an SCS Cloud to manage the their Infrastructure consisting of OpenStack Cloud Resources, Kubernetes Clusters, and Identity and Access management.

* We want to define a single point of managment with consistent experience for managing the entire infrastructure.

* We aim to establish an unified and central interface that provides customers 
of the SCS clouds with the ability to manage cloud resources and/or services.

* SIG explores the possibilities for a central API by creating a MVP.

### Matrix channel

* Use Mini-Hackathon Channel for this

### Label for Central API related work

* We want a label for GH issues

### Discussion on how to create Clusters

* @janiskemper described how the Syself approach with ClusterAPI works
* Discussed how the central API approach differs or how they can interact
    * Short discussion: K8s based API vs. basic Rest API
* Discussed how the different management clusters (central API, CAPI) can interact or even can be combined and what implication that would have.
* Syself will create an MVP on how Clusters are created at the end of the Sprint
    * We want to have a look on that and discuss interactions with the central API on the next SIG meeting
