## Agenda

- Tech preview release of Central API
    - We bundle up the PoC and document deployment for testing
    - Build of xpkgs in Zuul pipelines is currently blocked until the new Zuul setup with credential handling is ready
    - PR 15 is now merged, we built the xpkg artefacts for Harbor based on the tag `r7-tech-preview`
- AI @bitkeks: check update of docs.scs.community (https://docs.scs.community/docs/operating-scs/components/central-api/poc-setup)
    - For Tech Preview: Instead of `export VERSION=... # Currently repo git hash` use `export VERSION=r7-tech-preview` to pull the correct image
- AI @joshmue: Can we create an API overview for the Central API Kubernetes resources?
    - Currently it is not known from any docs what resources the Central API offers. Only after installation of the xpkg the resources can be queried in Kubernetes
- Open issues to be looked at: 
    - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/665 -> ongoing, blocked until secret handling is resolved
    - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/666 -> allowing to patch the "class" field to use another clsuter class version/release
    - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/667 -> allowing to patch "nodepools"
    - The compositions must be adaptable for different environments, e.g. cluster class, external_id
        - Using `external_id` is only relevant for Cluster Stacks, Gardener solves this differently
