## Agenda

### Feedback from the Hackathon (@o-otte)

- I.e. [Minutes of last meeting](https://input.scs.community/2024-scs-sig-central-api?both#Feedback-from-the-Hackathon1)
- Feedback PS:
    - In general there is a benefit for CSPs
    - For PS, as they only provide IaaS in "pluscloud open", it's not such a great fit
    - Target group definition is essential for the Central API
        - Target group focused on customers of providers that offer the complete stack and want to offer value for endusers
        - It should not be a tool for CSPs to set up their cloud
        - Value for CSP should be to offer that tooling to a customer
- Feedback from @gtema:
    - Central API can not be a 100% substitute for OpenStack APIs
    - Use cases that we want to cover should be documented
    - What in OpenStack is not covered by OpenStack APIs? Maybe confusion, everything should be covered. And even if something is missing - it will probably not relevant to the common use-cases for customers
    - Is declarative vs imperative a problem? (longer discussion, not relevant for Central API)
        - the wanted target state is part of most OpenStack API calls
        - the concept of reconciliation is not typically part of OpenStack
    - terraform/opentofu provider (used by Crossplane internally) can provide reconciliation
        - https://github.com/crossplane/upjet
    - opentofu provider has a broad coverage of OpenStack functionality
        - Additional functionality can be added into XPlane with moderate effort
- Result: Want a clear definition of target group and supported use cases


### Work on XRD [1] to Deploy Clusters (@mxmxchere)

- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/608
- Nothing to report, because of missing time
- Goal: Find a solution to connect to Cluster Stacks as well as Gardener
- Constraint: the customer always sees and uses only one defined XRD, without knowledge about backend system
- Implementation of composite at CSP site will be explored then (e.g. what happens if the CSP links the XRD to composite)
- Who to talk to regarding access to a preexisting Gardener setup?
    - Plusserver
    - Regio
    - Cleura
- Next steps: Flux and Gardener as ready setup (@jschoone, @mxmxchere, @joshmue)

### Update of docs to include Central API (@bitkeks)

- Central API should be included in https://docs.scs.community/docs
- Contents:
    1. Mission: Challenge to be solved
    2. Target audience: Customers of CSPs, end-users of APIs with workloads
    3. Use cases: scope of feature set
- @bitkeks will prepare first version, update in following SIG or in Ops call
