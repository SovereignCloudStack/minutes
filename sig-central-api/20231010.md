## Agenda

### Current Development
- Trying out Cluster Stacks Demo
    - Use Central API to create testing host for that
- @joshmue shows a short demo of the MVP

### Kamaji Lightning Talk and possible usecase for the central API

- To support Kamaji, a Cluster Stack needs to be created that supports it
- Can be a good idea to save resources on control planes for workload clusters

### PaaS Minihackathon Discussions
- decided to not use Zun because of the (possible) deprecation

### Dresden Hackathon
- Want to work on the central API there. We should have something ready to work on until then
    - StackXperts offer infrastructure if needed
