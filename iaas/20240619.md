## Agenda

### DNS breakout session postponed

Breakout session (originally planned for this monday) has been moved to 2024-06-24 (15:00)!

Context: https://input.scs.community/2023-scs-team-iaas#DNS-Standard-markus-hentsch

### Mandatory / Supported IaaS Services / APIs (@josephineSei)

https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/587
Problem: We had the discussion last week, that we would like to standardize APIs over OpenStack services. This will be a huge amount of work to be done, as we would have to look into all mandatory and supported service-API sets and decide for each API endpoint, whether it is mandatory, supported, unsupported or might even not work with our current standards or due to other limitations/deprecations (e.g. Neutron plugins, deprecated Nova endpoints, etc..)

- Markus and I discussed and want to propose a 2 step workflow:
    - we do not see anyone being able to complete such API level lists until September
    - We want to 1. stay with the overall sets of APIs, which should give a good direction of what we need to see in a cloud and what we are expecting to see in some clouds
        - what about saying: API compliant/compatible with "XXX" service 
        - phrasing: compatability to API based on OpenStack service
    - in a 2. step a more detailed version for each API can be done:
        - e.g. Compute API standard/DR describing at least all MUST have and MUST NOT have API endpoints (everything between should be optional)
        - overall standards like the role standard will not need this kind of detail and could work with theDR from step 1

### Key Manager Standard (@josephineSei)

Just Informational
- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/599 PR for Key Manager Standard; tl;dr:
    - Key Manager SHOULD be available in clouds
    - Master-KEK SHOULD NOT reside in plain-text in config (on Key Manager Host)
