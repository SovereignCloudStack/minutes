## Housekeeping

- Report in this weeks community call: @fkr
- Responsible for the minutes (writing and transfer to github): @gtema

## Agenda

### EOF IaaS Presentation & Signups (@fkr)

- 10 Minutes VP01 -> @berendt
- 5 Minutes VP03 (SDS / rook / rookify) -> someone from VP03
- 5 Minutes Wrap-Up overall -> @fkr

AI:

- @fkr to check with Friederike to get small extension to also include VP04

### Key Manager Standard (@josephineSei)

- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/599>
- any CSP around?
  - this standard recommends ("SHOULD") to use a key manager
  - note that this could turn into a requirement ("MUST") at some point
  - please read the standard and think about the consequences for your deployments
- feedback from at least one CSP would be good, any other feedback also welcome

AI:

- @fkr to mail CSPs asking for the feedback

### Availability Zone Standard (@josephineSei)

- I asked for input from CSPs a while ago (before my vacation) - but got nothing
- I wrote another mail to the ML
- We need input on this, because we are talking about physical features of deployments here, which are needed, so we can group resources into AZs on the IaaS Level
- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/640>

### List of mandatory and supported services (@josephineSei)

- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/587>
- is in a good state, got 2 approvals
- would want to merge it soon
- this is you last chance to review and state your opinion!

Notes:

- LBaaSv2 is a requirement (as KaaS needs it -- both capo and occm)
- Yaook based deployments are not having load-balancer service compatible with Octavia

### Image Encryption (Upstream Standardization)(@josephineSei, @markus-hentsch)

- Image encryption patchset: <https://review.opendev.org/q/topic:%22LUKS-image-encryption%22>
- Discussed upgrade workflow for CSPs (mail on openstack-ML: <https://lists.openstack.org/archives/list/openstack-discuss@lists.openstack.org/thread/URECEGF6FFK64PTGWNKJZOHESMW2I36T/>)
- need volunteers to test code in various infrastructures, to catch bugs early
- manual testing openstackclient examples: <https://gist.github.com/markus-hentsch/051e34252f4f9d0a4cbb7472665d872b>

### Feedback needed on Provider Network Standard (@kgube)

- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/572>
- There was an open question on how to deal with private and air-gapped clouds in the standard
  - the focus of the standard is on public IP allocation
    - I unsuccessfully tried to extend it to private/internal networks, but the requirements are too different
  - I have now tried to limit the requirements in the standard to clouds that offer public IP addresses
- Feedback from CSPs on the direction of the standard would be helpful

### Ensure all documentation is on docs.scs.community (@garloff / Product Board)

- Our turnkey solution will be an overview and instructions how to set up all pieces of SCS
- Linking to the installation instructions and docs on docs.scs.community

### Decision Record on Time Synchronization (@kgube)

- Issue: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/231>
- PR: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/577>
- Correct system time is important for certificate validation and helpful for log correlation
- There are a number of different options for guest time synchronization (NTP, PTP, Hardware emulation, paravirtualization)
- I drafted a decision record that discusses those options and gives justification for a standardized local NTP setup
- Feedback is welcome :)

### Testers needed for rookify (@fkr)

- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/rookify/tree/prs/enhance-ceph-pools>
- Contains all pieces required to migrate a running cluster to Rook
- Starts with a critical migration of the mon daemons
  - if too many mon daemons are deactivated (e.g. by an execution canceled) you will most likely break your existing cluster beyond repair
  - currently strongly recommended to run only in separate test environments easily restorable
- Test procedure
  - check out git branch `enhance-ceph-pools`
  - copy `config.example.yaml` or `config.example.osism.yaml` as `config.yaml` and adjust it's values
  - provide required configuration and keys for Ceph, Kubernetes and for SSH access to the nodes
  - build with `make up` or `make build-container`
    - Please have a look at the `README.md` for additional Make commands
  - run Rookify with `make run-rookify`
  - be prepared to restore your test environment right away
  - ensure to delete `data.pickle` before new clean executions
