## Agenda

### Review Requests (@josephineSei)

- Create a standard for the security of iaas service software: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/765 (from @josephineSei - either we get it merged (as draft) this week or it will stay open)
- Some of the statements are generic, we should create a structure of standards with a
    - Generic modules
    - Specific modules (for OpenStack, for Kubernetes, for the Vertical tools: Ops, IAM, ..., for Infra Compoentnes and later PaaS services)
    - This is a medium term improvement, let's merge 765 as draft now


### Stabilize scs-0123-v1 (@mbuechse, @garloff)

- draft on [docs page](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0123-v1-mandatory-and-supported-IaaS-services)
- PR [standards#828](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/828)
    - changes status field, but also includes one minor improvement
- independent of this PR
    - manual test obligation due to requirement that S3 implementation be described and endpoints be publicly documented
    - will add a new testcase for this manual test to the certificate scope SCS-compatible IaaS v5 (to be stabilized on Thursday, Nov 21)
- ceilometer has no API (has been removed years ago)
    - Remove it from the standard before merging
- Consensus
