## Agenda

### Greenfield rook deployments (@yeoldegrove)

- Update on the current status of rook greenfield deployments
- PRs are actively being worked on:
  - https://github.com/osism/ansible-playbooks/pull/411
  - https://github.com/osism/ansible-collection-services/pull/1427
  - https://github.com/osism/osism.github.io/pull/588
- Rook Operator is depolyable since quite some time now.
- Rook CephCluster CRD and any other CRDs can be deployed now after the above PRs are merged.
- Documentation is also being worked on.
- No documentation on how to deploy this on the Testbed is there yet, but basically it is:

```
# on manager node
/opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/005-kubernetes.sh
pip install kubernetes # will be taken care of, soon
## TODO: remove after merge
docker exec -u root -it osism-ansible /change.sh services rook
docker exec -u root -it osism-ansible /change.sh playbooks rook
## Apply new roles
osism apply rook-operator
osism apply rook
osism apply rook-fetch-keys
```

- will apply every CRD in https://github.com/osism/ansible-collection-services/pull/1427/files#diff-3fd2a7e19c4a325e0216c58f6d1214926bff01b1bbc7693e03d124a5494b5479
  - design choices
    - Similar variable that are available now for ceph-ansible will be there, so that we have a similar feature set.
    - not every Rook setting will be available as an ansible variable
      - This will just get too complex.
    - you can overwrite EVERYTHING with your custom `.yml.j2` CRD files for complete flexibility.

- OpenStack integration is also already in a "working" state, as Ceph Keyrings are already integrated in kolla-ansible.
  - this works the same way than as, by placing the keyring into the config directories

- Rook "rgw Keystone and Swift integration" is currently in the backlog
  - https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/1027
  - We're trying to get a status from upstream Rook if there is an idea on when the feature will be available.
  - AI @fkr: connect Jan from Uhurutec with @yeoldegrove

- Feedback is welcome, preferable in https://matrix.to/#/#scs-vp03:matrix.org
  - Which feature are you still missing?
  - Could you deploy your production scenarios with this already?

### Any news regarding vm migration / status

- no feedback yet
- possible alternative to [hystax](https://hystax.com/cloud-migration/):
    - https://github.com/cloudbase/coriolis
    - license needed as well, pricing unknown


### VPNaaS based on OVN

Is enabled upstream (ovn-vpn agent) in Caracal.
Not yet in kolla-ansible.

* Upstream issue in kolla-ansible: https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/2048392 (January 2024) (no issue for kolla at the moment)
* Upstream commit in openstack/neutron-vpnaas: https://github.com/openstack/neutron-vpnaas/commit/256464aea691f8b4957ba668a117963353f34e4c (November 2023, first included in Neutron 24.0.0 (OpenStack 2024.1))
* An SCS issue with this requirement does not currently exist (also in the OSISM org there is no issue available for this at the moment)

Q:
* Do we get this for R7? -> issue would need to be created to request this
* Backports needed?
