## Agenda

### IaaS ADR on providing virtio-rng entropy source #234
- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/234
- PR ongoing https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/297
- request for comment!
    - Should we require (or presume) presence of RDSEED/RDRAND instructions?
    - Should we introduce flavors with true HRNG?
- => [discussion results](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/234#issuecomment-1580197129), goal to complete issue by next Wednesday

### Stabilize the SSD flavor decision. #199
- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/199
    - Note: somehow the [ADR has been redesignated and moved](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/241) to Standards, even though it only documents the decision to *change scs-0100*
- Prerequisite done: draft(!) [scs-0100-v3-flavor-naming](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0100-v3-flavor-naming.md)
    - demote flavors with root disks to "recommended"
    - add two SSD flavors
- Will be compared/discussed/voted against to alternative proposal from PS (ReneL) later (deadline 2023-06-14)
- AI @mbuechse to open PR which sets `type` to `Decision` and `status` to `Stable`, goal to stabilize by next week's IaaS Team Call.

### Split mandatory flavors from flavor naming
- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/267
- Rationale
    - it seems easier to reach agreement on mandatory flavors than on naming
    - naming might change or even cease to be a topic altogether, but mandatory flavors won't
    - => Let's do the split! After taking the final SCS-v3 vs. PS naming decision (2023-06-14).
- Can we reanimate the discussion regarding name mapping/[aliases](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/228)/[dynamic selection](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/287)?
    - Flavor aliases [#228] could be pushed upstream via blueprint and patch (with SCS-specifics removed) ... -> @fkr -> Public Cloud SIG
