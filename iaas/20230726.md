### Sprint Gothenburg review, Sprint Hobart planning

- [issues/#268](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/268): Can be closed, has been backported and will be in 5.3.0
- [issues/#269](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/269): Refinement metric collection done
    - Next: Documentation [issues/#273](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/273), integration tests [#346](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/346), [#363](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/363), <https://quay.io/repository/osism/metering?tab=info>, demo and [blog post #370](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/370) wanted, odoo as demonstrator
- volume types [standards/#323](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/323), do NOT require cross-AZ attachability (mention that this is not guaranteed)
- certification set v4 for Sept 2023 (R5) [standards/#317](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/317)
    - Deep dive and finalization in 2023-08-23 in Team IaaS meeting

### 5.3.0 (R4.3)
- Update of OpenStack containers from stable branches
- Technical Preview: k8s on management/control plane (with k3s, [k3s-ansible](https://github.com/techno-tim/k3s-ansible/), kube-VIP, metal-LB) for management plane extensibility (old epic [#247](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/247))
- ToDo: ADR for k3 choice [issues/#371](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/371)
- Moving keycloak to k8s: Likely after 6.0.0

### R5 (aka 6.0.0)
- SIG Release (release coordination, release engineering)
- CfP: Please contribute!
    - OSISM: @berendt will participate/drive

### Central API Server for SCS
- Idea to have a central API point with consistent semantics for all SCS services (IaaS, IAM, Container, Metering, (Future) Platform Services, ...)
    - Use kube-apiserver logic for this
- SIG to drive an MVP (@o-otte, @joshmue leading)
    - Final decision based on MVP feasibility learnings
    - Participation from all areas wanted

### ceph
- collecting playbooks for more complex configs (using lvm volumes)
- creating lvms, referencing them by uuid (lvm-volumes key) and generating config for ceph-ansible by scripts
    - avoid possible overlap with ceph-volume?
- https://github.com/osism/ansible-playbooks/tree/feature/ceph-configure-lvm-volumes
- [osism issues #595](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/595) - playbook to create/configure OSDs
- [osism issues #565](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/565) - doc OSD addition
- [osism issues #413](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/413) - decomissioning playbook
- [osism issues #613](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/613) - evaluate integration in ceph-volume
