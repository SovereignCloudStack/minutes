## Recurring items
 * Who is presenting in weekly community call and transforming 
   etherpad to minutes in GitHub?
    - @matfechner

* Anything else to add to the agenda?
* @tibeer ask for: closed very old issues (nearly two years)
  - good approach, things can be reopened if the interest reemerges

## Agenda

### Confidential Computing

* Numerous backlog items, many of which traditionally blocked by missing
  hardware, how to proceed?

* Hardware installed now, devstack installed for testing, looking at SGX
* OpenStack (Train) enablement already completed by an asian business unit
  from intel,  available as many (large!) patches
  - Need forward-porting to main, retesting and upstreaming, 
    waiting for OK from intel legal
  - TODO: Track as stories (AI: @fkr w/ support from OSISM)

* Open: AMD SEV enablement is highly relevant for CSPs, 
  may already be in good shape from [OpenStackDocs](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/sev.html),
  AMD interested in collaborating (-> lightning talk?), 
  Ralf can facilitate communication (and we know Patrick Masse via Gaia-X)

### Update kubernetes on the management plane

* Epics are not yet existing
  - Should start creating them so we can include this in our planning
     - *TODO: @berendt and @fkr*
  - What should be in R4? Released? Tech Preview?
  - Plan: Use existing ansible role to do the basic enablement, fairly 
    moderate effort
 
* Should be available in R4 as TP
* Migrating many services in management plane will happen for R5
* Upgrade path R3 -> R4 -> R5: Existing services from ansible-deployed 
  to k8s-deployed requires additional work
* Stepwise enablement of feature:
  - creating cluster (on existing management nodes -- or control nodes)
  - migrate over first service (prior to R4)
  - moving over in upgrade is straight-forward for stateless services

### Halfway towards R4

* Ceph upgrade Pacific -> Quincy
  - is Quincy production grade (mature enough) already? 
    Paul has still some doubts ...
* TODO @OSISM: Clarify 
  - technically, the upgrade is already 
    prepared by OSISM *offered as TechPreview*
* Yoga to Zed
  - prepared by OSISM, started testing
  - barbican & cinder still with issues, rest smooth
  - Antilope starts a new release approach (Tick/Tock), 
    still need to clarify how to deal with it

* Ubuntu 22.04
  - kolla images now all based on 22.04, for R3 this was only the case 
    for OSISM based images
  - CiaB, preseed, roles all migrated to 22.04

* hddtemp dropped from 22.04
  - lm_sensors role needs creation *has more features as well*
  - Tests done, PR needs to be done
  - apt warning *trusted key handling changed*
  - k8s-capi images still based on 20.04, may need change upstream
    by SIG or downstream by OSISM/23tech *TODO: @berendt to* [open issue for tracking](https://github.com/osism/k8s-capi-images/issues/162)
* SCS is standardized -> which standards that play into the iaas ref. impl. are to be ready for R4
  - DNS, NTP, Networking, ...NEED attention. Issues:
  - Integration into OSISM (validation and managers), e.g. osism validate flavors, images

* Disk Encryption
  - Work has been invested previously, documentation and benchmarks incomplete, can we complete this
  - Container team had requested disk encryption (data at rest) to be enabled by default (standard storage class)
* in ceph for block/object storage
* local storage needs local setup (dm-crypt/LUKS) for SCS-2V:8:20s and SCS-4V:16:100s flavors
  - User-owned keys (with storage in HSM/barbican) is a separate topic

* [Ephemeral Storage](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/200)
  - Enablement needed for :20s and :100s flavors

* Cloud-in-a-Box:
  - Open items: Docu, more features from testbed (flavor creation, network connectivity, ceph)
  - No need for feature completeness
