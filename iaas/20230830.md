## Agenda

### Flavor names

https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/319

- extra specs for `cpu-type` and `diskN-type` will be added by @garloff directly after this meeting
- CI checked needed to assure consistency, github issue will be created (@garloff)
- can be merged once @garloff pushed extra specs.

### Image Standard

https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/314
- original upstream image source URL needs to be referenced
    - mirror urls from minio are not good
    - real mirror moved from minio to swift bucket
    - https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/issues/639
- "latest" needs to be resolved to create a stable URL
- One repo with standard image definitions in image-manager
    - Can be adjusted by user, source URLs with local files will be possible, not yet done
- Don't fix/recommend the version for k8s capi images in the image naming std, just the naming scheme
- AI: @berendt, @fkr and @mbuechse to finalize tomorrow 
- For the record: The ill-advised image signature recommendation is already gone :thumbsup:


### Volume types

https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/323
* Difficult to standardize, lots of things are very implementation dependant
* @JosephineSei to add volume definition (cinder volumes)
* Relevant properties for users: encryption, protection against data loss (redundancy), performance properties (QoS / Latency / Bandwidth), ~~Migratability (supports live-migration)~~
    * Backend specific things could be made transparent (without SCS requiring anything except for the transparency)
* Will be a set of recommendations only
* Not as prominent/visible as flavors
* Side discussion: Local storage should NOT be exposed as cinder volumes -- volumes thus always support live-migration
    * AI @garloff: Enhance blog article: Mention live-migration

### Domain Manager policy

- does further discussion belong into IaaS or IAM calls?
    - Could be both, IAM has more space for this, so discuss it there, keep IaaS team informed
- where to put the policy file? (so we can create a PR)
    - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/184#issuecomment-1670987533
    - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/383
    - @berendt offering a tour through OSISM repo structure for @cah-link and @markus-hentsch

### Team Mission / Description

1) We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

The high-level (SCS) goal is to make deploying and operating conforming cloud infra easier.

2) Work on Epics and User Stories relating to the IaaS reference implementation
    - Identify, prepare & refine them
    - Prioritize them
    - Track progress
    - Keep overview
    - Keep our partners and community aligned to contribute
