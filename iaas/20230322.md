### What about R5?

- Proposal to do this on April 12th for Team IaaS: 10 - 12 CET
  - no hard objections from the Team
  - a lot of nodding
- Question about Retro: There will be a Retro, @fkr not sure which
  format to suggest, will happen until EOW this week

### Skopeo worker

- Wrapper around skopeo
- Need arose during development air-gap
- Containers need to be regularly synced from public registries
  to private registries
- Initial sync takes several days due to limits on upstream registries
  and the sheer amount of images to sync
   *(~ 270 container * the tags - traefik alone has 5k tags ;)*
- Should be re-used when registry.scs.community is brought up to date

### gnocchi & ceph

- Further discussion should happen along the ADR

  - @fkr will look at it until EOW

### Discussion Imagecrawler

- [SovereignCloudStack/issues#168](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/168)
- should have a dynamic behavior use the upstream meta-information of versions
- much rather than add arbitrary download capabilities, address upstream to
  have latest pointers to images.
  - We will assemble a list of upstreams that need to be contacted.
  - @matfechner @master-caster will take this up
  - @tibeer: vyos & cirros
