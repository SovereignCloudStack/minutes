### Deep dive into SONiC for SCS (@akafazov, @ignatov17)

HedgeDoc [link](https://input.scs.community/SCS-DR-SONIC-usage?both#SCS-Decision-Record-about-Enterprise-vs-Custom-SONiC)

- SONiC Background
- VP04 Results - SONIC Custom build-image
    - Self-built images vs. Edgecore enterprise images evaluation & decision
- Pros for custom image
- Cons for custom image
- Go-NoGO Decision regarding our community images

Discussion:
- Compatibility between Enterprise SONIC and Community SONIC (for add-on containers)
    - Supposedly same APIs (but different code)
- Vendor-independence
    - Custom community images will have a limited set of supported hardware (as we can't test everything without access to all HW)
        - HW specific bugfixes may be needed
        - Sometimes its hard to use the same SONIC version for different HW
- Stability challenges with community SONIC
    - HW device drivers
    - Specific utilities not working out of the box
    - 2023.05 -> .11 works (no visible regressions, but also bugs not addressed)
- Custom builds - would need to invest into build automation and CI if we wanted to move forward with it
    - Upstream: Azure pipielines are used ...
- Enterprise images are not free of issues either
- Sustainability of community SONIC for 2025+
    - Adoption in SCS users?
    - Healthy Community outside of SCS?
    - How to drive adoption?
        - Features: OVN control plane on network switches may drive adoption (though this can also be done on top of Enterprise SONIC)
            - Useful beyond SCS
        - GENEVE support
        - Stability improvements may help adoption
            - Goes back upstream
- Is SCS big enough to carry this and make it enterprise- ready?
    - SCS alone is not ... but ...
    - Can we help building a big enough healthy OSS community?
- Suggestion: SCS add-ons should work on both community and enterprise SONIC, not be restricted to "SCS-SONIC"
    - VP04 Community SONIC work should also go upstream directly
- Enterprise Images for Edgecore (but not Cisco) can be *used* free of charge, but paid support is available
- Suggestion: Keep divergence of community SONIC and enterprise SONIC in mind so avoid creating vendor dependencies
- TODO: Write ADR
- TODO: Clarify uncertainties (e.g. healthiness of SONIC community)
- TODO: More focus within VP04 after initial research
