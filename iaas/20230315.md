## Agenda

### Housekeeping

* Adjustment to Sprint Planning / Review
  * Container team sprint change was unaligned with IaaS+IAM+Ops
  * Adjust IaaS+IAM+Ops to start a new sprint next week (which is the R4 release week)

### Sprint Review & Planning

#### Validations

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/28>
  * RGW validator needs to be moved to R5 (-> new story: [osism/#429](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/429))
  * Most pieces ready for R4, Release Notes should be expanded -> done, see:
    * <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/pull/5>
    * Documentation? --> <https://github.com/osism/documentation/pull/466>
  * Ceph Validator -> done

#### Cloud-in-a-Box

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/116>
  * done
  * Release Notes still contains a fixme marker (Link to blog post)

* Blog posts (WIP): <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/pull/544>
  (publish before R4!)

#### ADR IaaS RNG

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/234>
* Next steps: Merge and then stabilize -> submitted into docs repo
* Header fields and filename need correction and then submitted to github/SCS/standards/Decisions, [docs#24](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/24), will be done today by @matfechner

#### Air-Gapped Part 1 - Mirroring (at OSISM)

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/90>
  * APT (.deb pkgs) is still missing (left out for now)
    * goal is to complete this for R4
    * Can be considered as done, missing APT Mirrors are not needed by the Testbed
    * It should be documented what is supported and what is planned for the future
      * Should be included in the blogpost, which is now already outdated, will be updated today by @tibeer
    * Release note entry (release-notes/PR#5) will be updated by @tibeer

#### Air-Gapped Part 2 - Docs & Tooling how to set up mirrors

-> R5 topic will discussed later

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/280>
  * osism/issues#408 -> DONE
  * Testbed: Manager Docker Daemon is about to be switched to the osism mirror
  * Testbed: Node Docker Daemons are still missing
  * Testbed: PyPi, Ansible-Galaxy and APT still missing
* Complete this past R4 (R4.x / v5.x)
  * bumped to R5
* Breakout to clarify R4 and past-R4 scope (@fkr)
  * missed due to time constraints
  * CW12?

#### Metrics-collection IaaS

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/269>

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/237>
  * planned to be finished next week by @horazont

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/271>
  * done, ceilometer & gnocchi are working, release notes snippet should go to osism testbed (osism/issues/#479), documentation at
    * <https://docs.osism.tech/configuration/environments/openstack.html>
    * <https://docs.osism.tech/deployment/services/openstack.html>
  * possibly a bug found, not relevant for #271 though.
    * (prometheus endpoint not found by ceilometer) still needs a bugfix -> open issue against testbed

* Challenge: Ceph object storage backend will struggle with lots of small objects after a longer time. Alternatives: For incoming data: File storage? Redis?
  * Breakout session: Overflow (Mon 15:05 CET) in the next weeks
    * <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/calendar/pull/138>

#### IaaS Flavor Names

* Discuss on 2023-03-15
* Prepare with concrete proposals
  * @garloff: v2 proposal with transition plan
    * <https://input.scs.community/Why-Standardized-Flavors-And-Names>
  * @fkr: metadata driven approach

Discussion on Proposal of @garloff:

* Reason: OpenStack demands flavors
* Need some way of having the same flavors across providers
* Problems with using just basic (CPU, Memory, Storage) properties, e.g. dealing with GPU specs
* Question on how to select flavors
* Is also on the agenda of the OpenStack public cloud SIG
* Need to proceed with suggestions 1+2, that also includes code changes to IaC tools
* Discussion on having mandatory flavors and/or having fixed names (Suggestion 3+4)
* Need to postpone this discussion and decision taking
  * Slot: Need to have CSP in that discussion and need to find a timeslot

#### IaaS Shared Filesystem as a Service

-> Not discussed

* Manila with cephfs/nfs
  * Available in kolla, needs integration work (for R5)
  * Needed for k8s RWX (but also other requests)
  * AI: @fkr and @matfechner will write the epic & stories

#### 5.0.0c Release @ Testbed

Done. 5.0.0c can be used for further tests.

Cleanup PR: <https://github.com/osism/testbed/pull/1540>
Test results (including Refstack): <https://zuul.services.betacloud.xyz/t/osism/buildset/9c015f7dbb7040c891cd5e49d35236a3>

* Upgrades working
* Final version next week with only minor fixes expected (prob on Monday)
