## Housekeeping

- Report in this weeks community call: @janhorstmann
- Responsible for the minutes (writing and transfer to github): @fkr
- Skip Team IaaS on next Wednesday due to EOF event?

## Agenda

### Taxonomy of Failsafe Levels (@josephineSei)

- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/579>
- @martinmo and I restructured this DR
- we would like to see people check for sanity
- KaaS parts are still partly missing (will go to container team meeting and ask for intput there)

### Outline for presentation at EOF event (@fkr)

- 10 minutes IaaS reference implementation and upstream OpenStack
- 10 minutes software defined storage: rook and rookify
- 10 minutes software defined networking and wrap up

### Tests of RC for R7?

- PS is currently testing the latest RC on their development environment
  - Tests going very smooth so far
- Can the RC easily be tested on the CiaB?
  - <https://osism.tech/docs/guides/upgrade-guide/manager/> should work -- official confirmation from OSISM requested
- Sidenote: Rookify (Technical Preview! for migration of ceph-ansible to rook): Could it be tested with CiaB?

### Feedback on NTP decisions (@kgube)
- Feedback from Marc Schoechlin:
 	- time precision is very important for certain quorum based services (Zookeper, RabbitMQ, ...)
 	- CSPs should guarantee minimum precision
 	- Ideally three local NTP servers running on bare metal
 	- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/577#issuecomment-2301706489>
- Split discussion into internal usage (best practices, not SCS standard) AND what users see in their VMs (which should be part of an SCS standard)
  - For the latter, a way to communicate the existence&address of those local NTP servers to VMs is needed
    - vendor-data? (-> cloud-init)
      - Does not seem to be supported as Meta-Data standard, so it would not work on coreOS/CirrOS/Windows
      - Solution via cloud-init exists ... (but it's debatable whether it's too invasive)
    - DHCP defaults?
      - most cloud images accept them (not: AWS images, not a problem for SCS)
      - openstack subnets do not seem to have an option to provide NTP server DHCP options :-( by the provider -- unlike DNS
        - good upstream OpenStack feature request (spec)
  - Open discussion what is better ...
- Requirements:
  - Provided NTP servers should be used by user VMs with standard images as default without any special intervention by users out of the box (but of course it should be possible for users to override this manually)
    - <https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/17.2/topics/modules.html#ntp> - cloud-init seems to support that and vendor-data should follow the same pattern
