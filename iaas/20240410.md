## Housekeeping

- Report in this weeks community call: @matusjenca2

- Responsible for the minutes (writing and transfer to github): @matofeder

- Sign up for the Hackathon#4! <https://input.scs.community/Hy0HqULMTGeeVIcy0vmBgA>

## Agenda

### Hackathon #4 Prep Sessions (@fkr)

- 5 Minutes

- Our next hackathon is upcoming next week
- In order to make good use of the time there, we should make sure to prep our sessions well
- One idea that @fkr added a while ago is:
  - <https://input.scs.community/Hy0HqULMTGeeVIcy0vmBgA#ROOM-1---Turning-CiaB-Cloud-in-a-Box-from-a-dev-toolkit-to-an-edge-solution-fkr>
  - Are people interested in working on this? Other topics?
  - Interested: @artificial-intelligence

### Reminder: Barbican Plugin Check (@josephineSei, @markus-hentsch)

- until now no one gave us information, so again we call for interaction
- For <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/509>
- Call for CSPs to tell us, whether they use Barbican and which Plugin(s) they use:
  - AI: @all @fkr: Please just add a "**+**" in here: <https://input.scs.community/Xy5SLtTjQAqn-fgliIFp3A>

### Reminder: Availability Zones (@josephineSei)

- We want to check, whether we can standardize what to expect from an AZ within a deployment
- Call for CSPs to describe their current AZ usage
  - add your information here: <https://input.scs.community/Availability-Zone-Usage?both>
  - related issue: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/539>

### OpenStack service lists (@josephineSei, @markus-hentsch)

- For several issues, we need lists of mandatory, supported and (maybe only implicit) unsupported OpenStack services
- A first draft of the list: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/173>
- Please review and prioritize, because this is blocking other issues

- AI @markus-hentsch, @josephineSei: Write reminder mail to scs-tech, followed up by fkr with CSPs as needed. Goal is to take decisions next week.

### Backups vor Ceph Mons (@poelzi)

- Quick overview of the current development state
- Pointers to the PRs
- Asses on how to test
- How to make sure this will be present in R7?

Some initial links provided by him (inserted by @b1-luettje)

- Mon Backups: <https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/56772>
- Feedback: <https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/63801>

Plus 2 seemingly very-nice-to-have PRs to increase dev experience

- <https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/56751>
- <https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/56795>

### Default Security Group Rules (@josephineSei)

- decision needed for default rules
- Confusing: default SG includes ingress from itself, newly created custom SGs do not
- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/521>
- Discussions/Decisions:
  - SCS should not diverge from the upstream defaults
    - If those are not good, let's discuss there
  - Standardize what is default
  - Things can be confusing, so a blog article is very much desired
    - Multiple SGs can be assigned to a server (a port)
    - Creating a server on the cmd line with a custom sec group will not include the default sg (unless you explicitly tell it to)
- ToDo: Blog post (@markus-hentsch, @fkr)
- ToDo: Investigate momore to decide whether we want an upstream discussion and change

### Secure Connection Standard (@markus-hentsch)

- Issue: [issues#547](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/547)
- PR: [standards#548](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/548)
- Goals:
  - be more binding than the OpenStack Security Guide
  - make CSPs use properly configured TLS for APIs, DB & Message Queue traffic
  - secure Nova live-migration
  - secure Neutron networking
- Standard
  - currently references OpenStack Security Guide where applicable
  - mandates TLS version and cipher settings currently considered appropriate
  - tries to be sensible where to mandate and where to only recommend stuff to keep things realistic for CSPs
  - Test suite checks TLS settings for all public OpenStack API endpoints, most things cannot be tested from external and need internal audit
- please review! :)
- Q: any communication channels I missed?
- Discussion:
  - The fact that mere mortals^Wusers can not check everything is not a blocker
  - Mixture of mandatory requirements and recommendations is a good approach (with the idea that recommendations can become required at some point in the future)
  - Feedback from IaaS implementations (OSISM, yaook) will be very useful

### VP04 Lot2a node to node Encryption proposed on Kolla vPTG (@matusjenca2)

- 1 minute
- I proposed our solution to e2e encryption using VXLANs+IPSEC on Kolla vPTG
- Outcome: for OVN it's implementable in Kolla, for OVS such implementation is out of scope

### Reminder - VP10 - IPv4/v6 standardization breakout session tomorrow (11.04.24) 14:05 (@cah-patrickthiem)

- PR to look at for preparation: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/522#issuecomment-2047067192>
