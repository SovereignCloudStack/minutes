## Agenda

### Update re: TLS in Secure Connections Standard (@markus-hentsch)

~ 5 Minutes

PR: [standards#547](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/547)

- standard has been changed to reference the Mozilla presets for TLS settings
  - reduces the burden on SCS substantially by referencing externally maintained TLS guidelines
  - test script changed to directly test against the Mozilla preset
    - community AI: please try the test script against your cloud
      - <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/tree/feat/secure-communication/Tests/iaas/secure-connections>
  - problem: Mozilla presets are a moving target, i.e. versioned independently
    - updates might be critical due to the nature of the topic, so maybe cannot wait for new standard version
- SIG Standardization/Certification discussed on 2024-05-16 how to handle this
  - Mozilla's recommendations can be version-pinned as JSONs, the testing library (sslyze) can be version-pinned as well
  - major versions will be lifted with each new certificate scope version, within a certificate scope version, the references may only be lifted at minor- or patch-level
  - @mbuechse is adding a mechanism to the certificate-scope YAML to parameterize standards to account for versioning of referenced specs or libraries
    - see PR [standards#595](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/595)

### Role Standard (@markus-hentsch)

10 ~ 15 Minutes

Issue: [issues#396](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/396)

PR: [standards#590](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/590)

- after defining mandatory/supported services in [issues#528](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/528), now revisited this task based on the resulting list of components
  - created new PR from scratch, incorporating all research results: [standards#590](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/590)
  - lots and lots of research, complex situation with the state of the upstream RBAC rework
  - in short: enforce_scope and enforce_new_defaults would modernize and streamline roles but break compatibility with orchestration like Heat and cause other issues
    - options not default in upstream yet, [upstream is aware of issues and postponed it](https://governance.openstack.org/tc/goals/selected/consistent-and-secure-rbac.html#the-issues-we-are-facing-with-scope-concept)
    - SCS wants Heat as supported service -> conflict
    - options also contradict the SCS' Domain Manager policy-only downstream implementation (limited to Keystone) until Domain Manager is integrated upstream
    - service-specific roles for Barbican and Octavia still necessary without these options
- Q: role for testing
  - test script needs "list_roles" permission in Keystone (admin-only per default), how to address?
    - a) give combined admin+member account = let CSP operator execute it
    - b) introduce "scs-conformance-tester" role and add "list_roles" permission to it = external tests possible
      - this could serve as the base for more tests in the future requiring more than member
      - this role would only be assigned to the technical user for Zuul
      - @josephineSei: this sounds like a need for the system-reader persona, but this would only work in setups with the new RBAC (so this would be the future^2)
  - A: variant a is favored, there were vetos against b from the community due to a permanent testing-only role in the cloud environment doesn't sound too thrilling
