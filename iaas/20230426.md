### sysctl settings (iptables)

https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/428

* (iptables-legacy workaround OR setting openvswitch driver needed to make R3 -> R4 upgrade work)
* ansible task overwrites the settings again, need to disable specific playbook
* Possible improvements (doc, automation, parameters) should end up in OSISM-5.2.0

### Ceph Quincy epics
https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/154
* @ppkuschy to write story and work on upgrading jobs and tests
* @ppkuschy is still concerned on quincy quality (create separate story @ppkuschy!)
    * Need to understand what issues are (still) existing and get them fixed (upstream) or at least understood and avoided 
* @flyersa has been using Quincy already in many installations (cephadm based) - exchanging experience is beneficial
