## Agenda

### OpenStack Flavor Manager for SCS Operators

* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/236
* list of (currently 26) mandatory flavors should be published as YAML
* validation tool will consume the YAML
* Flavor-Manager consumes YAML and is able to create and verify existing flavors in an OpenStack Cloud
* Should all flavors (provider-specific as well) be prefixed with SCS- if they follow the naming rules from the standard (https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/blob/main/Design-Docs/flavor-naming.md)?
  * should the question whether or not it is a mandatory flavor (that is thus available on all SCS clouds) be info that is in the meta information
* iterative approach, @tibeer starts building - discussing with @frosty-geek after first steps have been taken
* opinionated approach suggested by @fkr

### ADRs 

#### ADR for tenant dns

https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/229

* @matfechner will take this and write an initial draft in january

#### ADR for upstream dns

https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/230

* format tbd
* discussion wether this really is needed and wether it is over-engineered
* there are operators where different units/squads are responsible, where this could be hard to track
* to be commented accordingly and put into the backlog

#### ADR for ntp service

https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/231

* how to inject dhcp options properly
* @berendt: comment within the proposal (231) on how this could be configured
* there is a consensus that getting a known-good ntp via dhcp by default is good
* scepticism on how this can be built properly
* there will be a breakout  scheduled on this topic
* proposal: let us standardize that NTP must be accessible; either via a DHCP-announced NTP server operated by the cloud, or by having the cloud/subnet connected to the internet.
* will the correct timezone be set?-> if i assume correct time settings with NTP i may assume the "correct" timezone to be set
  * what is "correct"? All my boxes are UTC :-> (+1)
  * timezone is per VM, not set by provider (image can have a default)

#### ADR for virtio-rng

https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/234

* desirable!
* @matfechner will take this topic

#### Cloud in a Box

* @tibeer and @ra-beer got their box, next steps
* testbed/cloud-in-a-box/node-image repos
* cloud-in-a-box quickstart -> will then kickstart into the usage of the testbed on the cloud-in-a-box

Need to be moved to next meeting:
