## Agenda

### Management of orphaned Openstack resources (@scoopex)

See [Background Story](https://input.scs.community/OpenStack-Project-Cleanup.md), moved/enhanced by @garloff

* Resources that someone else depends on are normally prevented from deletion ("resource in usage")
* Even if not, it's the user's responsibility to not shoot himself
* BUT:

#### Project deletion problem
* OpenStack does not clean up projects that are deleted (like in `openstack loadbalancer delete --cascade`)
* OpenStack does not prevent project deletion of non-empty projects
* Problem: Leaves orphaned resources that noone but the admin can access and clean up (and they cost € and block things)
* Question: Seems like a stupid design. Why?

#### Options

* Disallow project deletion (not a real option :-))
* Require projects to be empty and clean before deletion
    * Also then also needs to revoke project-scoped tokens upon completion (to avoid race conditions w/ orphaned resources created after project is gone)
    * Or maybe a two-stage process to really be race-free
        * Stage 1 blocks the creation of new ressources within project ("Drain stage")
            * Then all things can be cleaned up and expected to end up with a clean slate
        * Stage 2 then removes the project and all tokens ... that could create anything in it
* Asynchronous cleanup jobs, executed after project deletion
    * Does not change the existing API behavior, operators can decide to activate/deactivate this(+)
    * Is capable to ratelimit the deletion speed to prevent load spikes (+)
* Clean up synchronously, executed as part of the deletion 
    * The API behaves in a more “logical” manner (+)
    * Changes the existing API behavior (-)
    * Project deletion will be slower (-)
* Add a cascaded deletion to project deletion
    * Possible with or without synchronous deletion
      * Synchronous: API request for project deletion finishes after all resources of the project and the project itself are deleted 
      * Asychronous: API request launches a transactional backgroup batch process which deletes related resources and the project (But: Parent Domain must be prevented from deletion until this is finished)
    * Execute the project deletion request on the api-serverside and automatically delete all connected resources before deleting the project
* Others?

#### Questions
* What is the SCS policy for this?
    * This should be standardized, no?

#### Additional points
* Application credentials belong (bound) to a project, should be cleaned up, will certainly no longer work
    * Keystone should be able to remove application credentials automatically for deleted projects ([see source code](https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/f7ffacb7ad2d09da01b00cf50192a5c2b2d899a1/keystone/resource/core.py#L524))
* Users, keypairs are not strictly belonging to a project, will need extra care
* [OSISM Resource manager](https://github.com/osism/openstack-resource-manager/blob/main/src/orphan.py): Script to be run by admins regularly (currently not done automatically)
* Basic decision:
    * User responsibility
    * Admin responsibility

#### Strawman proposal
* `openstack project delete` becomes asynchronous
* keystone queries all services in the service catalogue (according to a well-defined protocol) to find out if service has resources belonging to the project
* collects the results and reports them
* if no results exist, project would indeed be deleted
* otherwise user has to do work and clean up
    * tools should support it (openstack cli project cleanup does it mostly)
* defense-in-depth (e.g. against races): regular asynchronous search for orphans and report (not yet: automated cleanup) for admins
    * e.g. Resource Manager
    * Admins should be (technically and legally) safe to delete such orphaned resources ...
