## Agenda

### whoop whoop whoop R3 is there

### Swiss Army Knife for OpenStack - the tools formerly known as OpenStack FOO Manager

 * [openstack-image-manager](https://docs.osism.tech/openstack-image-manager/)
 * Merge of all existing openstack-*-manager projects into one tool [issue 317](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/317)

"We need a complete rewrite" @frosty-geek -
 since we can't add the meta-data that the spec requires.
 or do we need to extend it massively. How do we proceed there?
  - Support version specific meta data [issue333](https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/issues/333)

  - how is the intended workflow of a CSP that wants to use 
    OpenStack Image Manager in order to implement the SCS specs of their clouds

  - SCS specific meta data has to be added to all available [images](https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/issues/332)

  - Documentation of usage is missing, as such the CSP does not know how to use the tool
    --> not missing, needs to be extended, [openstack-image-manager](https://docs.osism.tech/openstack-image-manager/)

* Image Crawler -> jinja template -> SQLite

[openstack-image-crawler](https://github.com/costelter/openstack-image-crawler) to be integrated into swiss army knife

=> epic w/ proper user stories in sprint planning

conformance test subject to further fixes?

@frosty-geek: The project should provide the proper configs for the images
