* Official place for conformance tests is the standards (previously: Docs/Design-Docs) repo
* Reference implementation can use it or use independent implementation (or nothing) as needed
* TODO: Check which code does better validation and move it to the standards repo
* TODO: Need framework/testsuite (ran continuously) that calls the various conformance tests against a platform
