### Debugging of OpenStack cinder problems at Artcodix (@janhorstmann)
* Symptoms: Arbitrary failure of certain volume actions
  * Handling of requests in cinder and involvement of rabbitmq in interaction between cinder-API, -scheduler and -volume-service
  * Pin-pointing rabbitmq as source of the problem
  * Debugging of rabbitmq cluster state and subsequent reset of the cluster
* To Do: Records learnings
    * How to analyze and address such issues?
    * Add to [troubleshooting guide](https://osism.tech/docs/guides/troubleshooting-guide/), [copy at SCS](https://docs.scs.community/docs/iaas/guides/troubleshooting-guide/)
