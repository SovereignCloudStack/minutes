### Discoverability in OpenStack (@fkr & @artifical-intelligence @gtema)
- 20-30 Minutes including discussion
- Report from the efforts that comes out of the Public-Cloud SIG
    - Create Design Doc that describes a new discoverability service
    - This would also help providers that are stuck with older OpenStack versions
- User stories collected:  https://input.scs.community/ZfP4d2kNTbagN9-Jk2ccEQ
    - User perspective: Allow to describe the attributes of wanted properties
   - Flavors: extra_specs provides *some* information
        - But fetching all flavors and searching on the client is solving only parts of the challenge at best
        - Server-side extra_specs filtering would help a bit
    - Separate service allows to describe multiple services, e.g. also volume types
        - encryption, redundancy, performance, ... properties currently not exposed (unlike multi-attach)
        - could be added to extra_specs
        - user stories added by @josephinesei: [#449](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/449)
- Follow-up discussion @ FOSDEM and vPTG

### VP04 Kolla Redis TLS (@matusjenca2)

- 5-10 Minutes
- Report status of Kolla ansible  Redis support (with TLS)
- Request review of upstream PR in [oslo.cache](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/oslo.cache/+/907211) and [kolla-ansible](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/kolla-ansible/+/903978)
- memcached does not support TLS, so use redis
    - PoC working @matusjenca2
    - Requires oslo.cache patches (even without TLS support), please review https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/oslo.cache/+/907211


### Clevis Tang / NBDE (@fkr)
- 5 Minutes
- How to proceed with this? We need a sponsor who will step up and maintain this upstream within OSISM
- Understanding of @fkr is: Wavecon is interested in this and want to use and deploy it (required for C5)
- Suggestion: Wavecon maintains this within OSISM
    - We don't know its current state (no tests, no docs)
    - ToDo: Create bugs/issues in the OSISM Repository to have the role not get deprecated (@berendt)
        - If we get commitments that this will be addressed, it could become a TechPreview instead of being deprecated
