#### Tests / Zuul ansible-collections 
* Molecule zuul job [#664](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/664) -- needs refinement

#### Misc
* flavor- and image-manager work well
    * image download by glance hanging [#656](https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/issues/656) is mysterious -- image download taking very long? Spotty or disallowed internet connection? Slow disks?
* R6 planning will be done -- prioritize ideas from the project sketch vs priorities in R6/R7.
* Related documents section in standards/ADRs can/should link docs from any public source, not restricted to SCS
