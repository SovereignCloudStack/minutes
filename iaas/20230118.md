## Agenda

### Sprint review

* Validations for deployment environments
  * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/28
  * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/225
    - PR for OSDs was just merged, Mons already there
    - various consistency checks (crush maps, encryption, ...)
    - documentation is WIP, also deserves more highlighting in Release Notes (generic remark on osism validate existing now is too modest)
    - validator should produce json, another tool should then use that json to create a human-readable report (sosreport)

* OpenStack Image Manager for CSPs
  * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/168
  * Felix as guinea pig succeeded in using it on a testbed deployment without serious confusion :-)
  * Some cleanup on docs structure needed to help doc generation automation (related to #336, AI @berendt for @ra-beer)
  * Image crawler code has been integrated, but in cleanup and not yet used (TODO: @berendt, @fkr, @costelter to meet and move forward).    - Also have a look at https://github.com/ovh/distronaut (https://distronaut.ovh)

* Cloud-in-a-box
  * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/116
  * decision for Upgrade OpenStack to Zed osism/cloud-in-a-box#31
    - Or: stable or latest?
    - If used for demos, showcases, development work on other layers, then stable is the better choice (v4.x.0 at this point), thus behind testbed (latest).
    - Decision: Stay on stable, need to pin CiaB to v4.x.0
    - osism/CiaB/#17: test-user/networking -> doing (when @ra-beer, @tibeer are back)

* Support Air Gap Installations #90
  * Pulp alternatives https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/348

* Compare performance of Ceph with and without encryption
  * https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/368
  * Benchmarks have been performed, need publishing (this week)
    - SCS Blog would be a great place for this!
  * TL;DR: You can saturate many cores when writing to NVMe

* OpenStack Flavor Manager for SCS Operators #236
  * https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/4?pane=issue&itemId=16291074
  * Appears to be complete ...
  * Please review #183 !

### Sprint planning

#### Cloud-in-a-box

* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/116
* decision for Upgrade OpenStack to Zed osism/cloud-in-a-box#31

  => User story for external connectivity missing?

#### Air-gap installations SCS/issues/#90

* New: Proxy in front of ansible-galaxy: SCS/issues/#252
* Completing this Epic is a goal for R4

#### Kubernetes-powered runtime on management plane

* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/247 (epic)
  * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/248
    - minikube, k0s, k3s, microk8s evaluated ... (=> k3s looks like the winner)
    - ansible-role: https://github.com/techno-tim/k3s-ansible
    - ADR would be good to document considerations (e.g. why no full k8s?) and decision
  * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/249

#### Flavor Manager

-> epic needs update with the latest issues

#### Confidential Computing #39

* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/245
      - Lightning talk from AMD / Patrick Masse requested
* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/246 -> needs to be broken down in further stories

#### @mfechner (ovn) -> need IaaS user story (from Team KaaS)

* L3 Loadbalancer wanted in OpenStack for perfect support externalTrafficPolicy: local
* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/251
