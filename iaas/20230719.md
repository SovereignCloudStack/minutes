## Agenda

### Walk the board

Since we had no Sprint Review / Planning last week 
(due to the SCS Project Team Retreat) I'd like to take the
chance that we look at the current Work-in-Progress items to
see if we're all aligned there.

- [issues/#268](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/268): Backport of ovn health mon fip fixes: Wanted for 5.3.0
- [issues/#269](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/269): Metrics collection
    - [issues/#320](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/320): Teach polling
    - [issues/#346](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/346): Integration
    - [issues/#270](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/270): Decisions, PR [standards/#308](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/308) -> upstream 

- Flavor aliases [standards/#228](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/228)
    - New direction: Introduce search interface into nova API
        - As discussed in [overflow slot](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/minutes/blob/main/iaas/20230710-overflow.md), also depicted in [standards/319](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/319) (decoupling)

### Placeholder for Items from SIG Standardization & Certification / VP 10.3

- Volume Type Standard Progress (Decision Record PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/323 , Standard Document WIP)
    - Discoverability needs significant work -- avoids mandating and putting everything into names
    - Please review PR!

- Image Standard:
    - Removing of Recommendation of Image Signature due to problems with download of certificate (@josephineSei)
        - admin registers public images normally
        - barbican certificate belongs to admin, normal user can not access it and image signature verification fails
        - workarounds possible (e.g. shared projects for secrets), but unpractical
        - AI: Adjust standard
    - More changes to the standard planned: 
        - How do we determine the list of mandatory and/or recommended images?
            - The only really required images are the CAPI images right now
            - Keep list short
            - Needs further discussion => PR from @berendt, @fkr
        - Currently we have both image metadata and a list of mandatory/recommended images in standard
            - TODO: Split into two standards
    - Need to mandate the possibility for users to register private images 
    - openstack-image-manager bugfixes and extension for restricted environments (@markus-hentsch)
        - detect stuck images and failed web downloads: https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/issues/617 + https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/pull/618
        - offer local file upload capabilities: https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/pull/619
