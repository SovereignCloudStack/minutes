## Housekeeping & Organizational Items

- Report in the community call by: @artificial-intelligence
- Responsible for the minutes (writing and transfer to github): @akafazov

### Action Items from last week's call:

- VP04: create specific attacker models until next meeting
- VP04: Check Geneve/VXLAN encryption in OVN
  - Encrypting OVN tunnels with IPsec 
  - rfc8926 ->  6.1.1. Inter-Data Center Traffic 

## Agenda

### Notice about a potential security issue (@josephineSei)

- 5 - 10 Minutes
- potential attack vector allowing admins and regular users to share security groups
    - `openstack network rbac create --target-project test-proj-2 --action access_as_external --type network test-net2`
        - Allows provisioning external networks to other projects (by just knowing the project name)
    - Solution: Policy
        ```
        "create_rbac_policy": "rule:admin_only"
        "create_rbac_policy:target_tenant": "rule:admin_only"
        ```
- AI: contact Openstack vulnerability management team (Jeremy Stanley @fungi) to identify if this is an actual vulnerability or by design (AI @JosephineSei)
    - Expected SCS reactions
        - warn or 
        - better disable by policy (for public clouds!)

### Current State of Testing R6 (@fkr)

- 10 Minutes needed
- release schedule is published
- reviewed testing - only CiaB has been tested -- much more needs to be done
- RC1 to be delayed by a few days for getting IAM pieces in
    - Reach out to PS
    - possibly makes sense to create new RC if the effort is low
    - PS confirmed they will start tomorrow with the testing
    - ->Will thus do RC1 (7.0.0b) today and possibly another one over the weekend

### Overview of day-2-tooling ceph (B1 & @fkr)

- 10 Minutes needed
- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/534
- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/535
- good start of migrating ceph to rook by B1
- managed migration to Rook without downtime :thumbsup:
- next task: create migration tool
    - create epic and user stories for this
- write new ADR that explains the decision and plans
- talk to @fkr, @jschoone to join the smaller group's discussions on this

### Upstream work on user roles (@josephineSei & @reqa & @fkr)

- 20 Minutes
- Report on upstream efforts for the user roles
- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/384
    - Openstack is rewriting security code (Secure RBAC project)
        - Project scope progressing ("Project Manager")
        - System scope runs into challenges
        - Manager with domain scope will come afterwards
            - Wait?
        - 12 possible personaes: Admin, Manager, Member, Reader on system, domain, project scope (4x3 = 12)
        - proposition to align with upstream
        - it also makes sense to take initiative, because upstream moves very slowly on this topic
    - Extend IAM to container space?
    - AI: @fkr will bring it to the attention of the product board
- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/405
- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/523
- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/360

- Man in the middle attach in scenarios with shared infrastructure (co-location): Rogue physical access to network cables or devices.

- IP spoofing is normally prevented by OpenStack (port security: allowed address pairs)
    * https://superuser.openinfra.dev/articles/managing-port-level-security-openstack/
    * https://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/networking/services-security-best-practices.html
        * (Needs update, `policy.json` is no longer)
    * May not be secure enough for L2 networking
- General observation: Somewhere the keys for en/decryption are handled, if the attack happens there, encryption does obviously not help. Threat modeling thus highly desirable. 
- When looking at inter-cloud connections, the traffic invariably will go via untrusted cables.
    - Encryption in the infra will allow users not to need to know about the details on where infra is located.
- Performance impact: May need opt-out for local trusted scenarios?
- Key management for cross-provider scenarios will be complex -> backlog for now. Begin with encryption OpenStack first
- Talk to Tellus project regarding non-OpenStack implementations
    - Exposing infra encryption capability to containers (so we do not end up encrypting twice)
        - Discoverability thing
        - External (non-SCS :-)) cloud providers may not be trusted
