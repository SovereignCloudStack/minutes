## Agenda

### vPTG is upcoming (@artificial-intelligence)

<https://openinfra.dev/ptg/> 2024-10-21 - 2024-10-25 virtual, so no excuse to not show up ;)

Project Team Gathering
(not around a campfire :fire:)

schedule: <https://ptg.opendev.org/ptg.html>

### Update on Public-Cloud SIG (@fkr)

<https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/publiccloud-sig>

especially:

<https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/publiccloud-sig#L21> and

<https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/publiccloud-sig#L37>

### Flavor deprecation marker (@mbuechse/@berendt)

Issue: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/744>

- PlusCloud Open seems to use the extra_spec `os:deprecation`, according to [their docs](https://github.com/plusserver/docs/commit/aab7f7044783e52ea71ab0140b61e2fb251ec907#diff-9ba625b8251e88c93f9bbf32736650e6a5e6cb65e60fe30600a3e77c99658fe4R58-R61)
- standardize this?
- this extra_spec is not part of the [official OpenStack list](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/configuration/extra-specs.html)
- we might prefer a more telling name(space), such as `scs:deprecation`
  - also because Nova uses extra_specs for scheduling
  - can we upstream this feature, then using a global namespace?
- [concrete proposal](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/744#issuecomment-2354836190)
- reuse the same key also for storage types etc. (then using metadata?)
- Side discussion:
  - We "abuse" `extra_specs` to carry metadata, would better be kept in a separate metadata (as is being introduced for volumes currently)
  - [quoting the Nova docs](https://docs.openstack.org/api-guide/compute/extra_specs_and_properties.html): "While there are standard extra specs, deployments can define their own extra specs to be used with host aggregates and custom scheduler filters as necessary. See the reference guide for more details." (So we are safe.)

### Mandatory and Supported APIs on IaaS Level (@josephineSei)

PR: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/587>

- Security SIG wanted to have S3 as mandatory (replacing Swift)
  - do we then still need Swift ("Object Store" API) in supported?
    - if we require S3 to be present, are there deployment with additional Object Stores?
  - testing might not differ between (swift) object store and s3 object storage - they are too similar
    - Problem is discoverability of S3 service when SWIFT is not listed in service catalogue
    - Use `openstack container list` or `openstack object list` to test swift API and get `ec2-credentials` and then authenticate the same object storage via S3 API (e.g. using libs3)
  - Agreement?:
    - Need someone to write test for clouds with only s3 !!!
    - Probably easiest to (mis)configure a CiaB this way
    - @mbuechse: We need a way to find S3 that is interoperable for all clouds that comply with SCS-compatible IaaS
- How can a reader know which API endpoints are meant with this standard?
  - Should we link some documentation? -> But that would be a reference to OpenStack again!
  - How old are they allowed to be? -> This leads to the question how old can an OpenStack software be to still be compliant
    - Should that be a different issue?
      - <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/749>
    - <https://releases.openstack.org/> <- different maintainance states.

### LAST CALL: Availability Zones (@josephineSei)

PR: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/640>

- no reviews from CSPs since last mention a few weeks ago :(
- reviews from @artificial-intelligence and @markus-hentsch also require CSP input
- List of Reviewers:

### Upstream contribution of subnet NTP server injection (@kgube)

Issue: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/231>
PR: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/577>

- We previously (2024-08-28) discussed the possibility of contributing a feature to inject NTP servers into subnets
- Q: should we have a breakout-session to discuss the specifics?
- Discuss in public cloud SIG, @fkr to add agenda item

### DNS Standard (@markus-hentsch)

Issue: [issues#229](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/229)
PR: [standards#570](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/570)

- lots of research about customer-facing DNS functionality of OpenStack done in the issue
- past discussion was mainly about what to impose on CSPs, how difficult DNS is to implement for CSPs (esp. local recursors and DNSSEC)
- summary of current draft:
  - Default/Upstream DNS:
    - local DNS recursors are RECOMMENDED, if you have them they MUST do DNSSEC
    - all non-local DNS servers offered must offer and validate DNSSEC
  - Internal DNS: internal DNS resolution in Neutron MUST be enabled
  - DNSaaS: Designate is optional but if you have it then you MUST enable Neutron extension for domain ports

### Lean Operator coffee next monday

- Use it also to gather feedback on standards from Operators
