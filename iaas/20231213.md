### Deprecation of Clevis/Tang service (@berendt)

appr. 2 minutes

- <https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/751>
- blogpost: <https://scs.community/2022/08/17/osism-nbde-install/>
- cleaning up old unused services, Clevis/Tang are next on the list
  - when writing unit tests for all services, these didn't work so the decision was made to remove them
  - Refactoring: moving Keycloak services to k8s plane
  - needed for C5 certifcation @Wavestack, moving it somewhere else (may be container layer)?
  - needs maintainers with knowledge in this area
  - AI: @fkr reaching out to SCS-Tech who will/wants to work on it

### Enablement & migration to ProxySQL (@berendt)

appr. 5 minutes

- <https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/787>
- ProxySQL will be the new default in kolla-ansible
  - preparation is done on osism side, works in Ciab already
  - this includes a disruption in the control and data plane during migration; this will be officially documented and tested @ regio.cloud in production
  - it is an opt-out if you want to avoid ProxySQL for some reason
  - discusssion with @stackXperts for reason for ProxySQL instead of HAProxy
    - cut down support matrix
    - similar approach as with RabbitMQ
    - <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/reference/databases/mariadb-guide.html#loadbalancer>
    - please test, docs will be prepared in the beginning of 2024
- <https://github.com/osism/cloud-in-a-box/pull/208>

### Domain Manager / Role Standard (@markus-hentsch)

appr. 5 minutes

- domain manager compatibility with Horizon and Terraform ([#383](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/383))
  - new fixes implemented, testing WIP by @berendt
- domain manager role proposed upstream ([#384](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/384))
  - bug: <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/2045974>
  - spec: <https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone-specs/+/903172>
- role standard ([#396](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/396))
  - draft written but stuck, see [comment here](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/396#issuecomment-1852491416)
  - policy defaults and settings are very complicated, hard to define a consistent and working standard for all services (while keeping domain manager compatibility)
    - needs more research and testing, see the github issue above for details

### API filter (@markus-hentsch)

appr. 10~15 minutes

- project to harden and limit the openstack api via a proxy; also limits feature set to needed scope
- created an OpenAPI spec for openstack api via automatic and manual work
- from the spec generated redoc HTML and python filter-api via fastapi-code-generator (docker container with traefik)
- the filter ensures that the filtered API matches the spec and the docs
- based on the old train release
- looking into how to make parts of this open source
  - maybe interesting for the SIG Central API?
- why was fastapi chosen?
  - because of requirements for the certification (to show that code is generated statically and can be verified)

### VP04 Networking (@fdobrovolny)

appr. 10~15 minutes

Lot 1 (SDN Scaling)

- SONiC image - build optimization finished [issues/484](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/484)
- WIP: SONiC issues for 7726 devices fixed, still issues for 7326
- WIP: SDN Blog post
- SONIC BGP Configuration Issue#487
Configuration of SONIC to implement architecture of Spine-Leaf with 1 Spine and 2 Leaf switches to route traffic with BGP routing protocol. Currently links between switches for building such architecture is not installed yet. Will continue on landscape soon. Configuration of BGP routing is tested in virtual environment (GNS3).
- SONIC switches in landscape Issue#500
Testing for installed links between hardware switches in landscape. Currently part of management port links are installed and for this hardware switches we perform testing of community SONIC build-images.

- there's the upcoming decision if we stick with SONIC or not
- AI: @akafazov proposal to prepare a list of pros/cons for next weeks meeting

Lot 2 (encryption)

- WIP: add support for Redis cache backend (PR review pending) [issue/#489](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/489)
  - @berendt of the opinion cache makes no sense in this case
- WIP: deploy MariaDB with TLS enabled [issue/#466](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/466)
- WIP: change services to use MariaDB with TLS [issue/#467](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/467)

Lot 3 (Cloud interconectivity)

- ADR in progress [issues/#501](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/501)

### Report from Public-Cloud SIG @ OIF on Flavor Discoverability (@fkr)

- <https://input.scs.community/ZfP4d2kNTbagN9-Jk2ccEQ?view>
- talked about using different testing frameworks
- (flavor) discoverability is a big topic:
  - suggestions from the nova team are lacking for the purpose
  - the current idea is to write a completely new discoverability service
    which can be added to any existing installation
- work is being done in the above hedgedoc and in #openstack-operator channel on irc.oftc.net IRC server
- everybody is invited to join!
