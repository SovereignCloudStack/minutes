## Agenda

#### Stabilize new standards for upcoming SCS-compatible IaaS v5 (@mbuechse)

- see Issue [standards#807](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/807) with one linked PR for each standard
    - Final call for any comments from the IaaS team
        - Team does not have any objections -> stanilization PRs could be merged, as they are approved
- the PRs are approved, but we need a consensus from the Team
- most partners already comply, see [compliance monitor](https://compliance.sovereignit.cloud/page/table)
    - Artcodix, WG Cloud are not compliant yet with v5 - fixes should be simple and be able to deployed soon
- biggest road blocks: (currently NOT taken into account for the final verdict):
  - *availability zones*: partners need to provide convincing documentation (floor plans etc., see [the standard](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0121-w1-Availability-Zones-Standard))
  - *domain manager*: again, partners need to provide documentation, such as the output of the test script (needs privileges and a somewhat intricate setup)
- open question:
  - should we include a testcase that covers the requirement that the master KEK must not be stored in plaintext? (this would again mean documentation from the CSP, namely regarding the overall security architecture); see [corresponding section in the testing notes](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0116-w1-key-manager-implementation-testing#manual-tests)
  - we can add this at a later date, now focus on having key manager in the first place

#### Feedback by the inventor of dm-clone on cinder driver (@janhorstmann)
* Got contacted by Constantinos Venetsanopoulos of [arrikto](https://www.arrikto.com/) (inventors of dm-clone)
  * Set up a meeting and discussed various aspects of storage in (multi-)cloud environments, e.g:
    * SCS and its role in funding the work on the cinder dm-clone driver
    * dm-clone in KVM live-migration scenarios
    * History leading to the creation of dm-clone
      * [grnet](https://okeanos.grnet.gr/home/) based on [ganeti](https://ganeti.org) and [synnefo](https://www.synnefo.org)
        * Local storage with live-migration based on [drbd](https://linbit.com/user-guides-and-product-documentation/) in ganeti
    * arrikto's kubernetes storage solution based on local NVMe dm-clone, dm-era, object-storage allowing near instant in-cluster storage migration and inter-cluster storage migration through a bittorrent-like protcol
      * [Documentation now available on their website](https://www.arrikto.com/rok-data-management-platform/)
    * dm-era is worth to investigate, and find the synergies between  arriko's solution and cinder-driver to potentialy improve cinder-driver (snapshots)

#### Automating SONiC switch provisioning and management with NetBox as a central source (@matofeder)

- Auto-provisioning and management of a fleet of SONiC switches by leveraging tools like Zero-Touch Provisioning (ZTP), Open Network Install Environment (ONIE), and NetBox as our single source of truth
    - Tested on SCS Hardware Lanscape - LAB environment
    - Code and documentation [hardware-landscape#23](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/hardware-landscape/pull/32)
    - Blog post [website#1045](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/pull/1045)

#### Call for Reviews

- Create a standard for the security of iaas service software: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/765
- Add standard for provider networks: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/572
