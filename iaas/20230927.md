## Agenda

### Housekeeping 

- Checking AIs of last week
    - AI @fkr: send mail to scs-tech@ to fish for reviewers (also featured in community call) - Domain Manager Role - âœ…

- A small info from the team
 
### Ceph RGW - CVE-2023-43040

- https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/26/10
- https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2216855
- https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-43040

- it is assumed that redhat is likely working on updated images
- only affects people that make use of bucket policies
    - these policies are used when CORS is used
- the current judgement is that this is NOT a large impact
- consent in the team is that we do not need to run around in panic, but if no new images appear on the horizon soonish (by tomorrow) at least publish a blogpost describing the impact
- "unprivileged user" not "unauthenticated user" - important distinction

### Exposure of internal services on the testbed manager external interface

- https://github.com/osism/terraform-base/pull/12
    - PR is approved
    - Nobody in the call objected


### Standards? PRs?

#### Domain Manager Standard (@markus-hentsch)

Main PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/343

Test implementation:

- new PR for the Domain Manager Standard PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/348/files
    - contains extensive tests verifying the conformance and security, about 60 tests in total
- questions:
    - should standard and tests be one PR or kept & reviewed separately / consecutively?
- consensus: should be a single PR and reviewed together

Role assignments by Domain Manager:

- current state: "member" is the one and only role that a Domain Manager might assign/revoke within a domain
- questions:
    1. should the standard allow to select a different role and/or define multiple eligible roles? (permitting the modification of the policy configuration to adjust the role(s) specific to the CSP)
    2. should a Domain Manager be able to assign/revoke the domain-manager role to/from other users within the domain?
- consensus: we should introduce flexibility into the standard, allowing the CSP to define the roles that a domain manager should be able to manage (except for the 'admin' role)

Decision Record:

- action item that requests a DR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/215
- the standards template offers "Decision Record" type but template does not account for a Decision Record structure
- questions:
    - should this be a separate document?
    - is freestyle okay?
        - example: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/commit/5941e3ed20b81f4e13c003775ee14eb9b049cc17
        - (note: I tried using a Markdown table for the decision entires but it's terribad for long sentences)
- consensus: should be included as an appendix to the standard document in this freestyle form
