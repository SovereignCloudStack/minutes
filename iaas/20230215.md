### Sprint Planning

=====

Will be discussed at Overflow Mon 2023-02-20

* Release preparations for 5.0.0
  * Cut of 5.0.0a until the mid of the next week
  * add of missing testbed-deploy-stable-next and testbed-deploy-stable-upgrade tests in osism/testbed
  * use of Ansible core 2.14 / Ansible v7 where possible (end of next week, no blocker expected there)
  * use of Ansible-Lint via Zuul everywhere
  * migration of check-yaml-syntax to Zuul
  * first check/sync of prepared 5.0.0 release notes
  * after cut of 5.0.0a: check if cloud-in-a-box is already usable
  * planning of test upgrade @ some PS test environment
* documentation for Ubuntu 20.04 -> 22.04 upgrade should be prepared for the next release before the next release (a test should be added to the testbed as well)
* Zuul role/deployment: Jens will get in contact with Benjamin to work on Zuul (also required for the TSI MVP)
* CI improvements: publish & test of osism/ci-image (should speedup CI builds by 15 minutes) in the testbed
* Replacement for hddtemp role (lmsensors) has to be completed in the next 2 weeks to be able to include it in the 5.0.0 release
* Test of Docker v23 in the Testbed and on some of our (OSISM) test environments
* we'll try to migrate all Ansible, Service + Kolla Container builds to Zuul (then we moved the most important jobs from Github Actions to Zuul)
* Paul will complete the Ceph benchmark blog post + started to work on a validator for Ceph RGW (<https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/429>), will not be finished before the next release :(
* Evaluation of new magnum-cluster-api plugin before the next release? (<https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/436>) IMO this could be a good hackathon topic
* Planning/discussion of <https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/433> (missing health checks in Kolla) in Nuremberg?
* discussion of <https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/360> (Zun service) possible? Enrico is required for this. Workaround how to use it at the moment is documented in the issue.
