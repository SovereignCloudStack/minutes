## Agenda

### Standardizing instance metadata (@mbuechse)

- see [standards/#580](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/580)
- open to discuss:
    - it could be desirable to standardize certain behaviour (within namespaces or so?)
    - Provider -> Customer information
    - Customer -> Provider wanted operational behavior
- Metadata: https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/user/metadata.html
    - very much different from properties or extra_specs (e.g., images, flavors)
- PlusServer uses metadata to announce certain "actions"

Discussion:

- metadata is user-modifiable, therefore any attempt for standardization will "fail"
- however, [deployer-provided metadata](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/rocky/user/vendordata.html#deployer-provided-data) cannot be changed by the user
- interference with Terraform could be a problem?
- there are other resources supporting metadata and may need to be considered as well

Tentative outcome:

- just/at least mandate the use of a non-scs namespace for those who want to use this facility
    - any item whose name doesn't start with scs is not portable
    - OR metadata is not portable AT ALL

### Bug in check script for the entropy standard (@mbuechse)

- see [standards/#673](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/673)
- according to [the standard](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0101-v1-entropy#images), absence of `rngd` is an ERROR, whereas the test script only reports a WARNING
- multiple clouds would no longer pass the test if it were changed
- how to proceed?

Discussion:

- from the standard POV it is required to have the service present _and running_
- cloud-init may be too late to start the process, so it needs to be enabled deeply in the image

Outcome (proposal):

- leave this as is right now and introduce new revision of the standard (changing language from "installed" to "running")

### Role Standard / Domain Manager (@markus-hentsch)

Issue: [#396](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/396)
PR draft: [standards#590](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/590)

- newest testing results show that upcoming Keystone 2024.2 will have *no* clash between `enforce_scope`/`enforce_new_defaults` and the SCS implementation of the Domain Manager anymore
    - even if the Domain Manager does not make it in 2024.2, using the new defaults does not prevent the SCS Domain Manager standard from being used as a downstream alternative
- with 2024.2 no blocker for the new role model seems to be remaining
    - SCS role standard will target 2024.2 and the new role model

### Cinder Volume Backup API (@markus-hentsch)

PR: [standards#567](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/567)

- just a quick reminder
- no new feedback
- current standard draft says:
    - MUST configure and offer volume backup API
    - SHOULD use dedicated storage backend for backups
- past discussion and feedback leaned towards favoring feature availability rather than backup realiability (mandating secondary storage) -> draft unchanged


### Local storage via OpenStack block storage (@janhorstmann)

- Introduction to a [driver concept based on the device-mapper clone target](https://scs.community/2024/07/12/local-block-storage-via-dm-clone/)
- Quick demo of a [PoC driver](https://github.com/janhorstmann/openstack-cinder/tree/feature/dev/dm-clone-driver) in a [testbed installation](https://github.com/osism/testbed/tree/preview/cinder_local_volumes)

FYI: https://fly.io/blog/machine-migrations/


### Ceph (rgw) support (missing) for ApplicationCredentials access rules (gtema)
- a test on one of the SCS clouds showed that application credentials created with access rules to enable "only" usage of object storage showed that RGW does not really support that
