### Swappiness

- On ceph nodes, swappiness defaults to 10 (adjusted in ceph-ansible down from linux default of 60)
  - 1st PR: Allow to override it easily (but not changing the default yet)
    - Not really required, whole dict can be overwritten (os_tuning_params), skip this for now, ceph-ansible repo
  - 2nd PR: Change default 10 -> 1 ?
    - Not yet enough experience to judge whether or not this is a good idea
    - Tradeoff: Failure mode in case of RAM shortage slowdown vs. crash
  - Watch out: Avoid conflicts with swappiness settings from compute host (kolla-ansible, osism-ansible) in hyperconverged setups

- <https://github.com/osism/defaults/commit/5b38b6104abf2dbca0d6c820e09ba4b3a4d14990>
