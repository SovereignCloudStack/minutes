- https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/499
Issue still exists on gx-scs, if the patch is included there (OSISM-5.1.0), then the upstream bugfix is incomplete. Need to report this.

#### Metric collection in the iaas reference implementation #269
- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/269
Document with metrics JSON format definition still needed.
    * Polling issue [#320](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/320) still WIP.
        - Ceilometer upstream opinion (RedHat) is that rabbitmq MUST be 100% reliable

    * Issue #273, ADR needed, start doing (Dublin)

    * Diagrams: VP13workflow.png (yet to be published by @cah-link) - update: ceilometer talks directly to metering tool (not all comm. goes via gnocchi) -> issue [#342](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/342)

#### Ceph Upgrade: Pacific -> Quincy
- https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/525
    - Refinement needed for Dublin
    - Status is opaque :-(
    - Create stories from task list, track completion
    - Behind original plan? @frosty-geek needs update for planning resources and updates at PS
- Ceph Reef release process has started (https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/61515)

#### AirGap #330
- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/330
    - aptly container has been created #334 -> still ongoing
    - helm chart for deployments has been created #335 -> still ongoing
    - #334 and #335 have a co-relation. a strange behaviour allows small mirrors to be updated, but when the time exceeds approximately 10 minutes, they get stuck in an infinite loop (python subprocess issue?). Interestingly, the processes are not flagged as zombies and still change on CPU consumption, but do not do anything any more
    - aptly mirror updates have been validated as functional #336 -> on hold due to #334 and #335
    - documentation has been created -> pending
    - release notes have been updated -> pending
