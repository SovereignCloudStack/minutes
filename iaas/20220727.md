* @itrich and @fkr present the overall epic as well as the next steps
* Good discussion on the various use-cases for cloud-in-a-box. While the epic already outlines a few of them, @horazont raised another very good one: Companies wanting to try out SCS (= OpenStack) who previously had other solutions and want to get a first impression before buying into this technology.
