### OpenStack Bobcat (2023.2) (@berendt)

- stable/2023.2 @ openstack/kolla + openstack/kolla-ansible done
    - release finalized
- PR for build of stable/2023.2 images pending @ osism/container-images-kolla
    - images published to docker registry
- we want to propose to disable the build of the following images in the future (to be discussed) (related to https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/718)
    - bifrost (in favor of the new osism/node-image + Redfish/VirtualISO based approach)
    - cloudkitty (in favor of our own metering approach/service)
    - kuryr (container neutron integration, reach out to k8s folks)
    - mistral (workflow service, used in OVH)
    - senlin (no PTL, broken CI gate, https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/governance/+/902626) --> identify use case if there is really a need for senlin to be able to fullfil this use case
    - swift (in SCS we use Ceph RGW which provides S3 and swift API, it's fine to keep swift if there are active users)
    - trove (database, no longer maintained upstream, better do DBaaS on top of k8s)
    - zun (in favor of Kubernetes)

- comments:
    - @garloff proposes 3 different categories for images:
        * officially supported (part of SCS)
        * provided (and should work), but no guarantees
        * discouraged and disabled
    - @fkr question about use of swift image in SCS, may be valid use cases
    - @artificial-intelligence - deadline for senlin to be marked as active; @fkr proposes to find alternative for this use case


### OSISM Release 6.0.2 finalised (@berendt)

- do not use 6.0.2 before Wednesday

### Supported Linux Kernel ~~versions~~ series (@berendt)

- https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/685
- https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/772
    - @garloff discouraging users to not install kernel updates may be a risky proposition
    - @berendt - this applies to the hardware enablement version and not to a exact version
    - Discussion outcome: Advertize what kernel series we use for testing and recommend this one

### Domain Manager / Roles (@markus-hentsch)

- announcement regarding continuation by @josephineSei in 2024
    - @markus-hentsch will leave SCS by end of year. @josephineSei will take over. @markus-hentsch will stay until end of next week (15.12.2023). SCS team members should contact him in timely manner.
- upstream domain visibility fix for "GET /v3/domains" for Domain Managers ([#446](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/446))
    - patchsets contributed some weeks ago
        - https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone/+/900028
        - https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone-tempest-plugin/+/900545
    - been asking in the Keystone IRC for reviews and assistance regarding the failing Zuul test but no reaction so far
    - @fkr to connect @markus-hentsch and @josephineSei to people (Artem Gonachrov = @gtema) from Openstack to resove upstream issues, interest on this also from Cleura (Artem's employer)
- Domain Manager standard
    - small extension for Octavia role support ([PR#396](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/396)) merged
    - WIP rework for old and new RBAC standards ([PR#384](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/384)) to improve compatibility with Horizon and Terraform
        - currently debugging together with @berendt)
- Role standard ([PR#378](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/378))
    - base frame finished, core part about what role configurations to apply missing
    - currently looking into the best way to describe the core configuration in a release-agnostic way using policy generation and simple guidelines
- upstream the Domain Manager role ([#384](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/384))
    - current TODO for @markus-hentsch, writing an [Identity Spec](https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/keystone-specs/specs/template.html)
    - getting things upstream is a challenge. Joining the keystone weekly video meet (google meet) is a good way to get things going. @artificial-intelligence to look it up


### Postponed agenda items for next week
- Deprecation of Clevis/Tang service (@berendt)
- Enablement & migration to ProxySQL (@berendt)
