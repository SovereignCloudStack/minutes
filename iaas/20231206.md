### OpenStack Bobcat (2023.2) (@berendt)

* stable/2023.2 @ openstack/kolla + openstack/kolla-ansible done
  * release finalized
* PR for build of stable/2023.2 images pending @ osism/container-images-kolla
  * images published to docker registry
* we want to propose to disable the build of the following images in the future (to be discussed) (related to <https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/718>)
  * bifrost (in favor of the new osism/node-image + Redfish/VirtualISO based approach)
  * cloudkitty (in favor of our own metering approach/service)
  * kuryr (container neutron integration, reach out to k8s folks)
  * mistral (workflow service, used in OVH)
  * senlin (no PTL, broken CI gate, <https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/governance/+/902626>) --> identify use case if there is really a need for senlin to be able to fullfil this use case
  * swift (in SCS we use Ceph RGW which provides S3 and swift API, it's fine to keep swift if there are active users)
  * trove (database, no longer maintained upstream, better do DBaaS on top of k8s)
  * zun (in favor of Kubernetes)

* comments:
  * @garloff proposes 3 different categories for images:
    * officially supported (part of SCS)
    * provided (and should work), but no guarantees
    * discouraged and disabled
  * @fkr question about use of swift image in SCS, may be valid use cases
  * @artificial-intelligence - deadline for senlin to be marked as active; @fkr proposes to find alternative for this use case

### OSISM Release 6.0.2 finalised (@berendt)

* do not use 6.0.2 before Wednesday
* <https://release.osism.tech/notes/6.0.2.html>
  * only Manager is updated
  * some issues with Redis/pubsub identified
  * Plusserver automation in progress
  * improvements in osism-cli
  * @berendt - managing release notes with <https://docs.openstack.org/reno/latest/>
* _AI_ @berendt & @fkr: blog post on 6.0.2

### Supported Linux Kernel ~~versions~~ series (@berendt)

* <https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/685>
* <https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/772>
  * @garloff discouraging users to not install kernel updates may be a risky proposition
  * @berendt - this applies to the hardware enablement version and not to a exact version
  * Discussion outcome: Advertize what kernel series we use for testing and recommend this one

  * @markus-hentsch will leave SCS by end of year. @josephineSei will take over. @markus-hentsch will stay until end of next week (15.12.2023). SCS team members should contact him in timely manner.
* upstream domain visibility fix for "GET /v3/domains" for Domain Managers ([#446](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/446))
  * patchsets contributed some weeks ago
    * <https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone/+/900028>
    * <https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone-tempest-plugin/+/900545>
  * been asking in the Keystone IRC for reviews and assistance regarding the failing Zuul test but no reaction so far
  * @fkr to connect @markus-hentsch and @josephineSei to people (Artem Gonachrov = @gtema) from Openstack to resove upstream issues, interest on this also from Cleura (Artem's employer)
* Domain Manager standard
  * small extension for Octavia role support ([PR#396](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/396)) merged
  * WIP rework for old and new RBAC standards ([PR#384](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/384)) to improve compatibility with Horizon and Terraform
    * currently debugging together with @berendt)
* Role standard ([PR#378](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/378))
  * base frame finished, core part about what role configurations to apply missing
  * currently looking into the best way to describe the core configuration in a release-agnostic way using policy generation and simple guidelines
* upstream the Domain Manager role ([#384](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/384))
  * current TODO for @markus-hentsch, writing an [Identity Spec](https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/keystone-specs/specs/template.html)
  * getting things upstream is a challenge. Joining the keystone weekly video meet (google meet) is a good way to get things going. @artificial-intelligence to look it up

### Postponed agenda items for next week
* Deprecation of Clevis/Tang service (@berendt)
* Enablement & migration to ProxySQL (@berendt)
