## Discussion about advised OSISM guidance to setup an production Cloud environment

What are typical control, compute roles and which services 
belongs to these roles and which not.  And which services and application should
run on other layers in the SCS-stack

https://docs.osism.tech/overview/service-architecture.html
https://docs.osism.tech/overview/node-types.html

Fully dedicated nodes may be best choice for very large environment.
Smaller environments may be better served with some sharing as depicted below:

Manager node(s) (usually one node)
==================================
services
  - currently only keycloak, to be moved to control planes in the future

Control nodes (min 3 nodes)
===========================
services
  - galera (min 3 for quorum)
  - ceph (min 3 for quorum)
  - future: keycloak

Compute nodes (dedicated nodes, might be hyperconverged with storage nodes)
===========================================================================
services
- nova

Storage nodes (dedicated nodes, might be hyperconverged with compute nodes, separate network recommended then for storage traffic)
==================================================================================================================================
services
- ceph

Network nodes (useful, if you want to integrate external services. net-nodes can be put into DMZ)
=================================================================================================
services
- may be required for security reasons / certification (e.g. BSI C5)

Growth from a small Hyperconverged setup into a more dedicated larger setup?
============================================================================
- Is possible ... but needs careful planning and execution
- Easiest approach: Setup new, more dedicated, environment and migrate over, switch off (and repurposed) old nodes

Data is all kept in
===================
- ceph OSDs
- (OpenStack) Database 
- (Logs) Elasticsearch
=> These are critical for availability
Also: rabbitmq to ensure data is flowing for consistency


Other Layers
=============
(Vertical services may be containerized on k8s, but not mandatory so)

 * Billing data / accounting
 * (Hashicorp) Vault
 * Monitoring / Logging

Keep them reasonably separate from infrastructure that is being managed
 * avoid dependency on own infra that you want to manage/measure/instrument
 * also avoid resource contention (prometheus, elasticsearch can be very taxing on infrastructure, e.g. IOPS)
 * needs to be scalable (containerized or virtualized)

To do: Create baseline: Set of blueprints for setups
 * Tiny, small, medium, large
 * Use this to document extra considerations that might change things
 * Currently we have roles documented (which need some finetuning), blueprints need to be written
 -> Add to sprint planning (IaaS team), start working on it in the coming weeks
 -> This is more generic than OSISM's view on our reference IaaS implementation
