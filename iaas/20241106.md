## Agenda

### Update on rookify

- Quick update on the current status of rookify
- Many bugfixes and PRs merged
- It was made sure that upstream also benefits and rookify is actually worthwhile for the wider community
  - rookify has become a generic approach to migrate ceph installations to rook
- what is the technical maturity?
  * migration: corner cases are hard to cover all
  * afterwards - rook is probably at least as resilient in operating the storage cluster as the previous solution (ceph-ansible)

### Security of IaaS Software (@josephineSei)

- PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/765
- narrowed down to only reflect IaaS components
    - opened issues for other Layers:
        - Hardware Layer: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/790
        - Operating System Layer: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/791 (anything below virtualization)
        - KaaS: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/792

### Mandatory and Supported IaaS Lists of APIs (@josephineSei / @gtema)

- PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/587
    - Important to have a baseline for users (ISVs / DevOps teams)

### Moving the Node to Node encryption ADR to Standards (@OgarOgarovic)

- PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/805
- ADR about the IPsec encryption of compute communication
- originally merged in Drafts
- move it to Standards folder?
    - ToDo: adjust the README in the Drafts folder to avoid confusion
- reviews of the document are welcome
- upstream patches for implementing this exist
- this is not yet close to becoming a standard

### RCA for failed start of Galera cluster in Lab? (@garloff -> scoopex, ...)
- Current understanding is that the reason for failure was full disks
    - OpenSearch tends to fill up disks ...
    - Recommendation to split out opensearch into its own storage volume
    - Autostart sequencing could be improved

### Update on cinder work

- https://scs.community/2024/07/12/local-block-storage-via-dm-clone/
    - Has evolved meanwhile, new blogpost needed
- Idea was welcome, spec needs to be written


### FYI: absence of cinder-backup not handled well (@markus-hentsch)

- Cinder documentation says that cinder-backup is entirely optional
    - volume backup API endpoints are always active though
- surfaced while executing volume backup standard test on clouds that don't ship cinder-backup
    - see [issues#795](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/795)
- if cinder-backup not present:
    - users can create volume backups (`openstack volume backup create`)
    - those volume backups will enter "error" state
    - users *cannot* delete those backups (`openstack volume backup delete`)
        - garbage resource pile up
    - users cannot query the API for the presence of the cinder-backup and its functionality
- upstream bug report created: https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2086683

Note: not a problem for SCS clouds necessarily as we will mandate cinder-backup in the next scope version.
