### Overview of changes in OSISM past three weeks (@berendt)

* Needed time: 5 - 10 mins

* Revive of the osism.services.nexus role
* Integration of the Nexus service as an additional passthrough cache in osism/testbed (CI only at the moment, thanks @ Marc for pushing this topic)
* Revive of the osism/ci-image, a machine image optimised for the deployment of the osism/testbed
* A lot of optimisations in the osism/testbed for the CI (deployment times below appr. 1.5 hours for deployment of OpenStack, Kubernetes & Ceph (including Refstack 2022.11))
* Test & use of the current state of the Domain Manager policy (no more failed tests in Refstack 2022.11), also added an ID test
* Deployment of the Kubernetes cluster on the management plane & the control plane (keycloak using it), more things to be converted (e.g. cluster-api bash -> role)
* Fix of a lot of UIs in the osism/testbed (thanks @ Marc for testing & the issue), caused by terraform moved into separate repo
* new service: lloadd (load balancer for LDAP)
* new play to get the Octavia certificates generated by Kolla (thanks @ Andre for the issue & the initial task)
* new ansible plugin: osism.commons.still_alive
* Retry functionality in the osism apply command (thanks @ Eric for the idea)
* Test & use of newer Ansible versions with ceph-ansible (stable/quincy)
* Started minifying the container images (WIP)
* Prepare use of OpenStack 2023.2 (Bobcat) (Cookiecutter, Images, .)
* Most of the testinfra tests for osism.commons & osism.services are done

### Testing OSISM vs. First-Touch SCS Environment (@fkr & @berendt)

* Needed time: 5 mins

* Q: What is the testbed?
  A: OSISM spread over many repos, testbed is the primary tool to do integration tests, is heavily used for continuous and nightly testing, upgrade tests, ...
  * Occasional breakage is to be expected (and hard to avoid)
  * Secondary usage to use as platform to do development on top or for demos obviously does not appreciate the occasional breakage
    * ToDo: Document how to instead use CiaB or the stable branch instead for some of these use cases
  
* Q: What is offered to people who want to have a 'first touch SCS environment'?
  A: To Be Documented

### Outline of epic-0 for SDS - Deployment and day-2-ops tooling software defined storage (@fkr & @yeoldegrove) - VP03

* Needed time: 10 mins

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/515>

* VP03 Hedgedoc: <https://input.scs.community/Pp1KtKn0TWegje2KYPA-_A>

### CI test for flavor-name syntax in scs-0103 yaml file (@mbuechse)

* Time needed: 3 min
* yaml file containing the required/recommended flavors is redundant
  * spells out flavor properties explicitly even though they are implicit in the flavor name
  * reason: separation of concerns: this standard could outlive the flavor name standard
* CI gate shall make sure that explicit properties and name are consistent
* [Please review PR #438](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/438)

_AI for @garloff, @fkr and @artifical-intelligence_: review until EOW.

### Document process for achieving a certificate (@mbuechse)

* Time needed: 3 min
* [Please review PR #356](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/356) -- waiting for input on "unusual" scenarios (airgapped etc.)

_AI @fkr_: e-mail @flyersa with a reminder to please review this
