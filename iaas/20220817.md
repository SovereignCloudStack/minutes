* Discussion on python version
* python-3.11 may help to speed up ansible
* Critically investigate python docker images (SBOM)
   -> *TODO: Attack this more generally prior to R4 (AI Kurt: Write epic)*

### Backlog: Pick stories to refine

* Spring planning: Pick stories to work on - prioritize doc/testing and things that can be completed prior to R3
* SBOM work (including documentation also to clarify R3 vs v4.0.0 confusion)
* Missing: Container images content not yet visible WIP: use [syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) (integrated in the docker CLI, e.g. docker sbom quay.io/osism/keystone:yoga)
  to be done on completed images), packages installed by ansible are not listed yet either (manual tracking, double-check with proxy)
  (inspired by pulp work -- a mirror that only contains the needed software).
    -> *User Stories to be written (reference tasks/issues @OSISM #101, #283, #217)**

* What's missing for disk encryption for R3?
   - [x] Operator perspective: NBDE blog post, [SCS Infrastructure KeylessGo](https://scs.community/de/2022/08/17/osism-nbde-install/)
* User perspective: Performance benchmark missing -> Waiting for hardware setup (@Hetzner)
   - [-] [perfomance benchmarks](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/97)
          -> *not a blocker for R3*

* SCS img metadata to ironic registration docu
* Roles in infrastructure (and what to share)
