## Agenda

### Connection problems to FIPs using `neutron_ovn_distributed_fip=true` with ovn 22.09 and ovs 3.0.1

https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/490
* Blocks upgrade of production systems @ PS
* Workaround (disabling distributed routing) not desirable for PS
* Plan:
    * Upgrade to OvS 3.1 / OVN 2023.03 (@ PS test/comm envs)
    * Check situation with new OvS/OVN
    * Do bug report, debugging with new OvS/OVN
    * Timeframe: We need to resolve this quickly to avoid blocking upgrades for longer
    * PS, OSISM, StackXperts are caring for this!
* Side discussion: OVN exporter needs work
    * Containerization is a challenge (connections to database / dashboard)
    * Enrico has a good dashboard -> kolla-operations repo -> issue (@berendt -> @flyersa) (https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/491)


### Ubuntu 22.04 OVS/Neutron Bridge Issue

https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/428
* Workarounds available, need to be documented (in Release Notes)
    * Agreed solution: Setting OvS as Security Group driver is recommended
        * then the `net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=0` sysctl setting is no longer needed (which would conflict with docker), @flyersa to update misunderstandable wording 
    * Long-term might change default for OvS setups (short-term: prepare in cookie-cutter)
    * For now document in Release Notes (@matfechner, @flyersa)

### R4(v5.0.0) Zed container code status

Do we have policies on the recency of the upstream code base?
Determined by upstream kolla?
* We build on top of the maintained stable branches, so v5.0.0 should contain below fix, a v5.1.0 would contain the then current state of the maintained Zed branch.
* List of contained components in release repo: https://github.com/osism/release/blob/main/5.0.0/openstack-zed.yml, https://github.com/osism/sbom/blob/main/5.0.0/openstack.yml
    * Sidenote: The deployment could do a hash validation of the expected SBOM hashes (osism validate), this piece is WIP

Reason for asking: Octavia OVN LB would be perfect for k8s, except for missing HTTP HealthMon and for this [bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1956035), duplicate of this [bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1997418/). [Fix](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/ovn-octavia-provider/+/873860) was merged upstream and [backported](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/ovn-octavia-provider/+/875595) and merged to Zed at the end of February.

### R4 Retro IaaS Team

The retro will be on Friday, March 31st at 10:05 CEST.
If you've been active in the IaaS team throughout the R4 cycle, you should've received an invite.
If not: please contact @fkr.

### Heads-Up for April 5th

@fkr will be on PTO[+] between April 3rd and April 11th. The meeting on the April 5th will be moderated by @jschoone and can (should ;) be used for diving into technical issues that are pending.

[+] For non-US natives: Personal Time Off = Vacation

### R5 discussion
Big discussion on Apr 12
* R4 outcomes remain relevant, but may evolve
* Technical topics might include IPv6, shared filesystem (-> RWX for k8s CSI)
