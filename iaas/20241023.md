## Agenda


### Security of IaaS Software Standard (@josephineSei)

- PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/765
- what is a reasonable timeframe to integrate security patches noted in OSSNs and OSSAs?
    - we want to require CSPs to update as soon as possible
    - we may need to define a timeframe, with the release of an OSSN or OSSA or the according patches as a starting point
    - ?
- It is currently proposed, that CSPs provide proof to the OSBA about an update or just describe why they are not affected.
    - should we say in more detail what we expect here?
    - someone suggested a form to fill out
        - something like: A) not affect B) disabled function C) patched: (with one or two sentences on how: e.g. used patch provided from OpenStack)
    - For "SCS-open", SBOMs are required, and we could look at them
        - We encourage CSPs to provide SBOMs
        - Otherwise we need to trust
        - Testing (by tryning to exploit) requires engineering (develop the exploit) and needs legal protection to avoid 202c StGB (DE) "Hackerparagraph" prosecution


- [C5 Cert OPS-22 additonal Critea](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/Broschueren/C5_2020.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3) - not mandatory
    * Critical (CVSS = 9.0 – 10.0): 3 hours
    * High (CVSS = 7.0 – 8.9): 3 days
    * Mid (CVSS = 4.0 – 6.9): 1 month
    * Low (CVSS = 0.1 – 3.9): 3 months
    * The clock starts ticking once the patches are available (assuming you use a version that is maintained upstream, otherwise once the head branch is patched)
    * Discussion: Make it mandatory for SCS-compatible or just a recommendation?
    * -> Decision (for now): A recommendation only
