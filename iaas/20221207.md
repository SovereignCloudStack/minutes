* Along this quickstart guide @fkr should verify the workflow


#### Cloud in a Box Installer

* https://github.com/osism/node-image
* see README fors Variants
* Alongside those images, @fkr can test with this CiaB
* One CiaB should be shipped to @tibeer, @fkr to ask what happened to that


#### deletion in nova

https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/369

-> @fkr to create issue w/ feature-request or other useful f'up tasks


### Status gx-scs

* According to a private e-mail exchange between @fkr and @costelter the idea was to finish this up this week and @costelter wanted to reach out to scs-tech.


### CW51

Sprint Review and Planning will happen, @fkr will prepare this and handover @garloff, since @fkr will be PTO

### flavor-manager

* epic and user-stories need to be written.
* @tibeer and @fkr to meet on Dec 8th in order to write these out

### Additional notes took during meeting

@fkr:
- Status gx-scs
  - Open.
- How to deal with calendar week 51?
  - @fkr will ask @garloff to moderate Sprint Review

@master-caster: 
- Issue #216 Node Image
- Issues #28/#225 Ceph Validator:
  - Validation of external Ceph clusters planned?
    - Currently not / Out of scope

@tibeer:
- Asked for a Ticket for the Flavor Manager

Discussed in sprint review:
- Skipped:
  - Issue #95 Testbed setup with multiple Keycloaks
- Issue #168: OpenStack Image Manager for CSPs:
  - Ramona sent QuickStart guide / prepared documentation
  - Open: Prepare use of Docusaurus
  - Image crawler done for three images so far
    - Next step: Integrate with OpenStack Image Manager
    - Tool is ready to be integrated
- Issue #116: Cloud-in-a-Box:
  - @fkr asked about image to deploy it
    - @cberendt stated that the CiaB image has been ready since the Hackathon
  - @cberendt stated that Hardware is needed for testing/development either by sending it or giving remote access to Hardware
  - @fkr will test the image this evening (2022-12-07)
  - Benjamin Zapiec: Issue #216 - Evaluate current status of node-image
    - Had trouble deploying it in a VM
      - Not an issue since deploying in a VM is out of scope for the image
- Issue #135: SOSreport-like functionality:
  - Moved to on hold because it's blocked by/waiting for #225
- Issue #90: Support Air Gap installations
  Relies on
  - Issue #348: Prepare list of Pulp alternatives
- Issue #368: Compare Ceph performance with and without encryption
  - Hard disks are not likely to cause issues in terms of performance, as they're way too slow compared to flash
  - Three NVME SSDs in RAID 0 however are capable of fully saturating a 24 Core AMD EPYC CPU (with IO depth 32 and block sizes around 1 - 64 MiB)
    - Testing that needs to be done:
      - Evaluate using NVME crypto accelerator cards
      - Evaluate using built-in cryptography of the SSDs

- Issue #369: Check how local disks are deleted in the Nova service:
  - Still open/unclear
  - Need to create action item to ensure that local volumes will get properly shredded and not just simply removed
  - Might want to run nwipe over an LV before removing it from a VG --> Needs a hook to do that instead of just doing lvremove

@maxwolfs: 
 - Was asked by @ra-beer about status of Docusaurus:
   - Deployment needs to be fixed.
