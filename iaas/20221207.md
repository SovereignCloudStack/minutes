## Agenda

### Sprint-Review / Planning

#### Testbed w/ federated keycloak

* Issue #95 Testbed setup with multiple Keycloaks
* skipped. @reqa not present and currently not in focus.

#### Validations for ceph

* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/225
* mons done, mgr's next
* Discussion about scope, scope is about validating deployments via osism not a general validation of any ceph environments.

#### OpenStack Image Manager

#### Documentation

* PR by @ra-beer and @tibeer for quickstart guide: https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/pull/436
* Along this quickstart guide @fkr should verify the workflow
* Open: Prepare use of Docusaurus

#### Image Crawler

* Image crawler done for three images so far
* Next step: Integrate with OpenStack Image Manager, @berendt to discuss this and suggest how to proceed


#### Cloud in a Box Installer

* https://github.com/osism/node-image
* see README fors Variants

* @cberendt stated that Hardware is needed for testing/development either by sending it or giving remote access to Hardware
  * One CiaB should be shipped to @tibeer, @fkr to ask what happened to that
  * Added after meeting: will be taken care of until end-of-week

* @fkr will test the image this evening (2022-12-07) (DONE)

* @master-cater: Issue #216 - Evaluate current status of node-image
  * Had trouble deploying it in a VM
  * Not an issue since deploying in a VM is out of scope for the image

#### SOSreport-like functionality:

* Moved to on hold because it's blocked by/waiting for #225
* Issue #90: Support Air Gap installations
  * Relies on
    * Issue #348: Prepare list of Pulp alternatives

#### Ceph performance w/ encryption

* Issue #368: Compare Ceph performance with and without encryption
* Hard disks are not likely to cause issues in terms of performance, as they're way too slow compared to flash
* Three NVME SSDs in RAID 0 however are capable of fully saturating a 24 Core AMD EPYC CPU (with IO depth 32 and block sizes around 1 - 64 MiB)
  * Testing that needs to be done:
    * Evaluate using NVME crypto accelerator cards
    * Evaluate using built-in cryptography of the SSDs

#### deletion in nova

https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/369

* Issue #369: Check how local disks are deleted in the Nova service:
  * Still open/unclear
  * Need to create action item to ensure that local volumes will get properly shredded and not just simply removed
  * Might want to run nwipe over an LV before removing it from a VG --> Needs a hook to do that instead of just doing lvremove

* @fkr to create issue w/ feature-request or other useful f'up tasks

### Status gx-scs

* According to a private e-mail exchange between @fkr and @costelter the idea was to finish this up this week and @costelter wanted to reach out to scs-tech.


### CW51

Sprint Review and Planning will happen, @fkr will prepare this and handover @garloff, since @fkr will be PTO

### flavor-manager

* @tibeer raised this item, in order to have epic and userstories written out for the flavor-manager.
  * https://github.com/osism/openstack-flavor-manager
* @tibeer and @fkr to meet on Dec 8th in order to write these out
