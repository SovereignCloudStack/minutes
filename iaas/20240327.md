## Housekeeping

- First things first: Thanks @artifical-intelligence for stepping up to run this meeting this week!
- Attention: There is NO community call this week!
- Responsible for the minutes (writing and transfer to github): @akafazov
- Heads-Up: @fkr will not be available next week (due to another appointment) and we need someone to step up for next week: 2024-04-03
  - Any volunteers? @fdobrovolny
- Sign up for the Hackathon#4! <https://input.scs.community/Hy0HqULMTGeeVIcy0vmBgA>

## Agenda

### VP04 Lot 2a: Node to node encryption going with IPsec and VXLAN in OvS (@fdobrovolny)

![](https://input.scs.community/uploads/6890d072-2388-43e1-8b84-ff87185d8dcd.jpg)

- protecting traffic between VMs on the same host
- cilium agent runs on the host and traffic routed via it

- OVS networking
- uses IPSec tunnel

- encryption between the nodes (IPSec)
- encryption of openstack service endpoints in scope

**VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN)**: A network virtualization technology designed to address the scalability problems associated with large cloud computing deployments. It uses a VLAN-like encapsulation technique to encapsulate MAC-based OSI layer 2 Ethernet frames within layer 4 UDP packets, enabling the creation of virtualized Layer 2 networks over Layer 3 networks.

Open questions:
- Key managment
- Should be added to upstream? Or separate ansible role

### Security Groups (@josephineSei)

- Security Groups should not be standardized, but have a guide:
  - <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/473>
  - DR: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/495>
    - no one opposed since last week, so can we merge this DR?
  - draft of guide can be found here: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/142>
  - majority was for having a guide
- default Rules for Security Groups should be standardized:
  - <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/521>
  - PR: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/525>
  - CALL for CSPs to describe their default rules and what they would like
    - @berendt - do not use any extra default sec groups or rules

### Availability Zones (@josephineSei)

- We want to check, whether we can standardize what to expect from an AZ within a deployment
- Call for CSPs to describe their current AZ usage
  - add your information here: <https://input.scs.community/Availability-Zone-Usage?both>
  - related issue: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/539>

### PTG Preperation (@josephineSei)

- <https://input.scs.community/PTG-preparation#>
- gather issues we want to solve upstream and be prepared for the PTG in 2  weeks

### VP10 - IPv4 Networking Standard Proposal (@cah-patrickthiem)

~ 10-15 minutes

- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/522>
- Key suggestions so far:
  - Neutron Routers **MUST** be used
    - routing traffic between tenant and external networks
    - some edge cases exist where customers attach VyOS VMs to external networks without a router
    - some internet routing scenarios exist which do not use Neutron routers
  - OVN or L3agent **SHOULD** be used as high availability service deployments
  - Standard external networks **MUST NOT** be made accessible as shared networks
    - if external networks are marked as 'shared', instances can be attached to them directly
  - External networks and subnets **SHOULD** (very strong should) be configured with --no-dhcp
  - SCS conform CSPs **MAY** use RBAC and VPNaaS Neutron plugins
    - maybe we even make it a **SHOULD**
  - Security Groups **SHOULD** be enabled by default but **MUST** be capable of being switched off
  - standard quota of floating IPs and routers **SHOULD** be rather small, e.g. 3-5 floating IPs but if a user wants to use more of these resources, the user **SHOULD** be able to pay for more
  - SCS CSPs **SHOULD** implement monitoring solutions to track the utilization of IPv4 addresses
  - SCS clouds **SHOULD** adopt the naming convention scs-external-net for external
  - Floating IPs **MUST** be enabled
- Open questions
  - Naming Convention Flexibility: How rigid should the naming convention for external networks be across various SCS clouds?
    - all external networks can be found with `network list --external`
    - do we need to add a convention at all?
    - how many clouds have more than one external network for IPv4 or IPv6?
  - Load Balancing: Do we want to dictate a Load Balancer or a set of Load Balancers or nothing at all? E.g. Octavia, Yawol (<https://github.com/stackitcloud/yawol>)
    - maybe a general discussion would be good about this topic
    - we can also separate this into another issue - this issue is already big enough +1
    - related: [Define a list of mandatory and of optional (supported) SCS OpenStack services (issues#528)](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/528)
  - VPNaaS: Same like for Load Balancing, there are alternatives

- breakout session for discussion of the whole standard will be organized
  - Participants: @josephineSei, @artificial-intelligence
  - AI: @cah-patrickthiem organize a breakout session and publish it in the SCS calendar
- More ideas?

### VP04 Lot 2b: Upstream work on redis (@fdobrovolny)

    - redis will stay (may be as fork) for the future and will not impact the TLS work

- Should we try to find alternative to redis? e.g. use of different service
- Use of experimental memcached SSL
- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/562> - Implement use of redis as backend for Tooz orchestration/coordination in Ansible Kolla
- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/555> - Implement suport of redis in keystonemiddleware.auth_token
- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/489> - Implement ability of OpenStack services to use redis as their oslo caching backend
- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/464> - Implement ability of OpenStack services to use redis via TLS as their caching backend.
- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/463> - Add ability to deploy Redis with TLS enabled to Ansible Kolla
