## Housekeeping
- Report in this weeks community call: @matusjenca2
- Responsible for the minutes (writing and transfer to github): @markus-hentsch

## Agenda

### Barbican Plugin / Key-Manager Standard (@josephineSei ~5 min)
- Issue: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/509
- Standard: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/599
    - discussed in previous IAM call how to proceed with the Key Manager standard because there were no responses from CSPs so far, started writing standard for now 
    - standard checks for presence of key-manager
    - core guideline: Key-Manager SHOULD be used
    - CSPs SHOULD NOT store the Master-KEK in plain-text on the physical host
        - deliberately not a "MUST" because mandating HSM or similar is a big hurdle and might be detrimental to adoption

### Role Standard (@markus-hentsch)

PR: [#590](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/590)

5 ~ 10 Minutes

- @josephineSei noticed that components like Nova *do* override the oslo.policy defaults with their own defaults and already use enforce_new_defaults after all
    - standard needs to be updated accordingly as it currently assumes this isn't the case
- difficult situation considering all the limitations resulting from the WIP upstream RBAC rework and conflicting component configuration
    - new policy defaults incompatible with Heat
    - some components already use new defaults
- @fkr wanted to raise this in the product board meeting, whether we want to drop Heat to simplify things
    - any news on this?
    - meeting happened but topic didn't come up (no notes were taken)
- Q: is Heat still a problem?
    - the IRC meeting of Keystone still discusses this weekly
    - however, there is a merged change that suggests fixes: https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/heat/+/899067


### DNS Standard (@markus-hentsch)

Issue: [#229](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/229)
PR: [#570](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/570)

5 ~ 10 Minutes

- some discussion points are still open but hard to resolve in an asynchronous reply manner, can/should we schedule a breakout session?
- summary of open topics in the PR:
    - terminology / naming of category for DNS offered to tenant VMs
    - how to handle provider networks with different root zones
    - DNS over HTTPS vs DNS over TLS
    - DNSSEC usage complexity

### Standard Images unintuitive from CSP point of view (@markus-hentsch)

10 ~ 15 Minutes

Issue: [#534](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/534)

- scs-0104-v1-standard-images primarily standardizes the *process of creating* the list of standard images and its YAML format
    - it does not communicate well, *how* CSPs are supposed to actually implement the images to fulfill the standard
- mbuechse: "from my point of view, this standard merely regulates the format of the YAML file; which YAML file is ultimately used is not part of the standard, but a parameter of the certificate subject"
- markus-hentsch: from a CSP perspective, when I browse docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0104-v1-standard-images I want to know what I have to do, to fulfill the standard
    - in the [Markdown source](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0104-v1-standard-images.md?plain=1#L3) it is currently classified as "Standard" but it seems more like "Procedural" to me currently
- conflicting opinions on the correct way to address this
- mbuechse: indeed, it should be classified a "Procedural", and the yaml should be added as a [formal parameter](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/595/files#diff-7f34f98070083d9c5b0e8537bdf2efcd6b055a82e93a326241a6be06491684af) (so it can then be shown in the [documentation](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-compatible-iaas))
- apart from that: add specific implementation notes (Supplement document) to the standard to help CSPs
- also, maybe implementation notes should also appear on the certificate-scope overview page in the docs
- finally, check that implementation notes are suggested by the template (issue template for new standard as well as document template)
- _AI @mbuechse: make sure that these suggestions regarding the standard images standard are implemented (by writing issues to that effect or other appropriate means)_

### Provider Network Standard (@kgube)

05 ~ 10 Minutes

Issues: [#166](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/166), [#167](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/167)
PR: [#572](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/572)

- Request for reviews
- CSPs MUST provide provider network to access internet
    - there SHOULD only be one provider network by default
    - MUST be an external network
    - MAY be shared (allowing direct attachment of VMs)
    - MUST have IPv6 subnet
        - MUST have subnet pool for users to allocate public IPv6 subnets
        - MUST support dynamic routing
            - problem: technology not ready? it is not yet supported in the reference implementation (requires OVN with BGP)
            - huge hurdle for plusserver but they agree it should be done
            - AI @kgube: remove PR draft state, assign/gather reviewers
    - SHOULD have IPv4 subnet
        - MUST support floating IPs
        - MAY support subnet pool
- user SHOULD be prohibited from creating their own shared/external networks
    - those are usually only provided by the CSP
        - the "network rbac create" allows sharing networks as external (yes Neutron likes this)
- plusserver's view: make sure that this is really possible to achive with the reference implementation + figure out a way & timeline how to enable existing CSPs to retrofit this
- SCS / community question: does SCS require internet access? a.k.a. what about air-gapped infrastructures?
    - affects more standards (like DNS etc.) which would need to account for that scenario
    - AI @all: discuss this further, involve @fkr and @garloff
