## Agenda

### SCS Standards Compliance check basically red for the majority of environments (@fkr)

- See <https://docs.scs.community/standards/certification/overview>
- This was apparently discussed in SIG Standardization/Certification on July 25th (<https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/minutes/blob/main/sig-standardization/20240725.md#update-clouds-table-to-scs-compatible-iaas-v4>), nevertheless I hardly see any further actions / discussions. As such I wanted to bring this here to see why and how this affects the CSPs.

### Kubernetes-powered runtime for vertical services on management plane (@berendt & @fkr)

- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/247>

Discussion:

- we should better use processes and workflows created for managing K8 (and not the Ansible)
- most likely ArgoCD will be deployed to manage K8 applications

### Standard _scs-0104-v1_ on standard flavors revised (@mbuechse)

- issue [standards/#594](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/594), PR [standards/#677](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/677)
- please review
- summary:
  - reinterpret meaning of extra_spec `scs:name-vN`
    - formerly "name according to major version N of standard on flavor naming"
    - now just "name variant N" (valid for at least one of the major versions)
  - advantage 1: finally it's possible to specify multiple flavor names (the standard on flavor naming does recommend to use two names, a short one and one with all details)
  - advantage 2: not necessary to add an extra_spec for each major version (keep in mind that the names don't change from v2 to v3, and most names won't be affected by v4, v5, etc. either)
  - advantage 3: this change preserves compliance (i.e. any environment that complies with the standard before the change will do so after the change), so no new major version required
  - disadvantage: no explicit mention of the major version(s); if the same name is valid for multiple major versions, but with differences in meaning, then the extra_spec becomes useless(?)
- discussion:
  - no strong opinions
  - no objections

### Ability to phase out old OS images (@mbuechse/@martinmo)

- issue [standards/#684](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/684)
- with standard [scs-0104-v1](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0104-v1-standard-images), we can make certain VM images (referenced by name) mandatory or recommended (or optional), but so far we can't say that some image is "discouraged" or even "forbidden"
  - _mandatory_: if the image is not present, an error is emitted
  - _recommended_: if the image is not present, a warning is emitted
  - _discouraged_: if the image is present, a warning is emitted
  - _forbidden_: if the image is present, an error is emitted
  - (quick reminder: an error means that the environment won't be certified!)
- Q: shall we make these two values possible? (e.g., for distributions that are EOL)
  - some images might not be deletable because they are still referenced by some snapshot -- but they could be hidden/made private
    - hidden images can still be shown by a adding a specific request parameter but are not listed by default anymore
    - markus-hentsch: hiding images would be less impactful for CSPs and a good compromise?
  - optimistic approach: better to rely on the judgment of users, since distro versions are included in the image names
  - extended maintenance licenses may make the situation less clear ("EOL not for everyone") -- prefer a warning over an error any time -- which could in turn contribute to "warning fatigue"
  - adjacent point: do we have regulation on how quick new LTS versions have to be provided?

### Image metadata standard: typo or grave mistake? (@mbuechse/@martinmo)

- PR [standards/#690](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/690)
- [the standard](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0102-v1-image-metadata#technical-requirements-and-features) speaks of `min_disk_size`, but [the compliance checker](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/2d7f7d31ad5612c9db0699a626e2eace4e41c383/Tests/iaas/image-metadata/image-md-check.py#L274) and the [OSISM image spec yaml](https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/blob/dd0b4d298e9222fb1ef5eef24e419ea348b216a4/etc/images/opensuse.yml#L8) files do use `min_disk`
- so just call it a typo and tacitly fix it?
- discussion result: yes, do that

### Improve OpenStack service healthchecks with oslo.middleware (@berendt & @varkeen)
