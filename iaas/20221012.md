## Agenda

## local emphereal flavor for etcd  or database workload

### Zuul for SCS
* We have budget for cloud resources in our budget (testing, ...), 45k€ overall (3.6yrs)
  - If there are factual/technical reasons to require only a small portion (<10k€) for now, we should be able to compare offers as opposed to using a public tender process.
  - Requirement to use SCS infra, so our zuul automation works
  - Will migrate zuul controller to own hardware as soon as we have it
  - @o-otte will discuss with @berendt and @jnull about needed ressources, so that wavecon as well as pco can write an offer

### Testbed
* 3-4 goals/use-cases currently:
    - Getting started / SCS first impression (=> may be partially(?) replaced by Cloud-in-a-Box)
    - Developer Environment / Operator test Environment
    - CI (requires separating terraform and ansible deployment)
* TODO: Document the goals (#1367)
* May require more visible documentation and maybe further integration (via additional scripts or additional make targets) (#1368)
- Maybe better defaults (for inexperienced users) can help (#1369)
* May require a tutorial (that can be worked through serially, see https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/) in addition to the currently existing documentation (which is more reference doc style) (#1366)
* Reference for documentation types: https://diataxis.fr/

* Make "Getting started" for new uses as simple as possible: https://github.com/osism/testbed/issues/1366
* Add the use cases for which the testbed is there: https://github.com/osism/testbed/issues/1367
* Add a prep target to the Makefile: https://github.com/osism/testbed/issues/1368
* If necessary, adapt the defaults so that they can be used directly without preparation/adjustment: https://github.com/osism/testbed/issues/1369

@fkr -> to write an epic so that this is visible within the SCS scope
