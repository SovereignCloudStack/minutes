## Housekeeping & Organizational Items

- Report in the community call by: @fkr
- Responsible for the minutes (writing and transfer to github): ??? @garloff

## Agenda

### Back-porting of domain-list scoping (@fkr & @berendt)

- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/446#issuecomment-1975836431
- Has been merged upstream
- Upstream backport seems not very likely
    - Thus we have to wait to R7 (v8.0.0)
    - Could have an upstream discussion on the backstream backport policy (and possibly get it into v7.x this way)
        - Too black&white: bugfixes are not always low risk, sometimes features are very low risk
        - vPTG (TC) discussion (AI @fkr + )
- Too risky late in the RC cycle
- Too risky because of changed defaults
- Generic policy => Product Board discussion (@fkr)

### OVN 24.03.0 (@berendt)

* https://mail.openvswitch.org/pipermail/ovs-announce/2024-March/000344.html
* LTS release, should we switch to it?
* Late in the release cycle
* PS in favor

### OVS 3.3.0 (@berendt)

* https://mail.openvswitch.org/pipermail/ovs-announce/2024-February/000343.html
* Same thoughts as on OVN 24.03.0

### OSISM 7.0.0c (@berendt)

* Have there been any further tests of 7.0.0b?
* Should we do the 7.0.0c release later this day?
* Include the OvS and OVN upgrades into 7.0.0c (RC2)
    * https://github.com/osism/container-images-kolla/pull/402
    * https://github.com/osism/container-images-kolla/pull/403
    * PS will look into this specifically in their testing
* Ask for testing again with 7.0.0c (RC2)
    * @fkr

### Current state of TLS in some backend sevices (@berendt)

* MariaDB: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/465
* RabbitMQ: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/468
* Libvirt: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/533
* All of these need feedback and testing, so we can document the state (release notes)
    * VP04 engineers should support (@ AHackathon currently)

### OpenStack PTLs for 2024.2 (@berendt)

* https://github.com/openstack/election/tree/master/candidates/2024.2
* no candidates for the following projects
    * ec2-api
    * freezer
    * kuryr
    * murano
    * openstack-charms
    * sahara
    * senlin
    * _skyline_
    * solum
    * trove
    * watcher
* We are (optionally) using skyline, so that is not good
* Some of the others may or may be deprecated without effect on us

### List of mandatory / scs-supported / unsupported OpenStack services (@josephineSei)

* we need this for the role standard
* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/528
* Call to everyone to gather information about used services:
    * all services in this hedgedoc: https://input.scs.community/list-of-required-recommended-and-optional-openstack-projects?both
        * Current view is from upstream
        * Have to amend with SCS view
        * The deployment tooling probably should be on a separate list (as it's not affected by the standards)
            * We need kolla there obviously as OSISM builds on it
    * I provided first information about activity (all) and importance (some)
    * please add, whether you use a service and maybe rate the importance of it (and please add your github-handle or organization)

### Security Groups Standard (@josephineSei)

Idea to standardize a few security groups with rules
https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/473
* Why is this difficult, and why am I against a standard:
    * decision record draft: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/495
* default security group is created per project and should have the same default properties on all SCS clouds
    * Is currently hardcoded
    * Idea to change this: https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/neutron-specs/specs/2023.2/configurable-default-sg-rules.html
    * No need for action, should already be consistent across all SCS clouds
        * (The perceived misalignment was probably a misconcpetion by @garloff.)
* RBAC feature for security group sharing
    * Can share networks and SGs with another project (knowing the project ID)
    * https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/2054590/comments/2
    * https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/admin/config-rbac.html#preventing-regular-users-from-sharing-objects-with-each-other
    * Do we need to disable this?
        * Security risk?
        * Is it also possible to extend the policy so that you can only share with projects that you have access to?
    * Please read bug report and discussion, so we can have a good discussion next week!

### New deployment and day-2-ops tooling software defined storage (ceph) (@brueggemann)

- We now have a public github Project (kanban board) --> @fkr please make it public ;)
  - https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/18
  - gathered first issues that have to be taken care off
- We pushed to public repo: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/rookify
