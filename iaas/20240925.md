## Housekeeping

(Come on, make it smooth and just fill something in ;)

- Report in this weeks community call: @matofeder
- Responsible for the minutes (writing and transfer to github): @matofeder


- @fkr is at the OSBA Board meeting today, @garloff will facilitate the call. Thanks Kurt! :100: 
- @fkr will be PTO the next two weeks, likely @gtema will facilitate those calls. Thanks Artem! :rocket: 


## Agenda

### Deploy OpenSearch & Prometheus not on the control nodes by default (@berendt)

- deploy them on the manager node by default
- Rationale: IO contention issues (as observed by artcodix, e.g., in conjunction with RabbitMQ and mariadb)
- Proposal: Put it on the manager node (single instance deployment), document how to move it for multi-node setups (and recommending dedicated NVMes in that case)
- ToDo:
    - change it for R7.1 / OSISM 8.1: Document this is a breaking change in the release notes
        - follow docs to not lose (monitoring/log) data (migration)
        - document how to deploy them on the control nodes
        - document how to move already deployed OpenSearch/Prometheus services

### ADR for Rook is being reviewed

- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/737
- Have an opinion? Review the ADR :)
    - @markus-hentsch: ADR looks good and almost ready to merge, just minor comments (wording improvements) left there
        - @NotTheEvilOne will contact B1 team today and inform team regarding new review comments
        - @markus-hentsch will push some minor things on your own to the PR (if B1 colleague is not available to pick it up himself)
        - Should be merged today

### Mandatory IaaS Services (@josephineSei)

PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/587
- I added to the standard, that the endpoint which is used to talk to the object store MUST be published in the service catalog in the identity service (Keystone)
    - so we will always have an endpoint to test with or no object store at all
- I tested this with deployments without Object Storage and with a deployment with both s3 and Swift.
    - I need someone to test this script on a deployment which only has Swift enabled and not s3 and on a deployment with only s3 and not swift!
- I also found that the names of the services may differ between deployments (e.g. block-storage vs volume vs volumev3)

Discussion:
- Putting object storage in keystone service catalog without offering swift is confusing
- To avoid confusion we could always require SWIFT and S3
- Alternative is to publish S3 endpoint via a different mechanism (s3 test script supports libs3 style `S3_HOSTNAME` environment variable), would need to be made transparent via certifcation note
- CSP feedback: swift API not used (except for horizon dashboard)
- How to publish S3 (S3-only) endpoint?
    - A different endpoint type in keystone service catalogue for S3-only service?
        - An issue could be that OpenStack (Keystone) credentials could be used only for listing the OpenStack service catalogue (that could include S3 endpoint), but not to access the S3 service itself
        - Customer specific endpoints can be handled via endpoint filters ...
    - A better way than "read the documentation"
    - Gaia-X type Self-Description / Verifiable Credential should document keystone and S3-only enpoints
- Decision: CSPs either use SWIFT+S3 and publish it via keystone `object_storage` OR they separately pass the information to the certification (machine- readable way: TBD in the future)


### Release of OSISM 8.0.1 (@berendt)

- only an upgrade of the manager services is required
- Prometheus OpenStack exporter now disabled by default because of to many users reporting OOM issues
- fixed Postgres upgrade (issue #1081) in the Netbox service
- lot of improvements and bugfixes in Rook
    - non-hyperconverged setup supported now, validation, helm charts, annotations/labels, purging
    - still Technical Preview ... goal is to stabilize this before R8/OSISM9

### Mandating Network Auto-allocation Support in Provider Network Standard (@kgube)

- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/572#issuecomment-2346078428
- Automated setup of project network, subnet, and router connected to provider network with single API call
- requires one external provider network and one subnet pool (or two for dual stack) marked as "is_default"
- simplifies compliance tests for the standard
- are there any concerns regarding requiring this in the standard?
- not yet enabled in testbed (but WIP, [#2335](https://github.com/osism/testbed/pull/2335))
- AI @kgube: need to reach out to CSPs to find out about the provider network requirement being an issue or not
