### Confidential Computing

* RAM has been found for 80 days
  * 12 x 16GB modules
  * Intel will try to find a way to get RAM for longer period
  * RAM will be shipped to NBG, so that @ra-rau can deploy it
* Until this RAM is deployed, any further work on this topic is blocked

### Ampere

* Delivery address has been communicated to Kurt
* Hetzner has a partnership with Ampere, so if this urgent we could always revert to hetzner

### Zuul for SCS

* Quick tl;dr on what Zuul is by @berendt
* Quick overview on CI/CD in the SCS Project by @berendt
* it makes sense to have a dedicated SCS zuul
* everything is prepped
* deployment together osism and gonicus
* SCS project team needs to provide the environment
* Zuul consumes a node pool
  * SCS project team needs to provide this node pool
* we need to start with this soon and not wait until the SCS community hardware is ready
* jens will be back CW 31 and then there can be a call between OSISM and gonicus
