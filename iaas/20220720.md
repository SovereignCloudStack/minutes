  * RAM will be shipped to NBG, so that @ra-rau can deploy it
* Until this RAM is deployed, any further work on this topic is blocked

### Ampere

* Hetzner has a partnership with Ampere, so if this urgent we could always revert to hetzner

### Zuul for SCS

* everything is prepped

* SCS project team needs to provide the environment
* Zuul consumes a node pool
  * SCS project team needs to provide this node pool
