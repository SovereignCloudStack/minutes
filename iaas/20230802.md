## Agenda

### Domain admin role [issues/#184](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/184)
- Domain Admin alternative concept (@markus-hentsch)
    - OpenStack has limitations regarding proper scoping of the "admin" role (not properly limited to domains)
    - alternative concept introduces new role and Keystone policies
        - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/184#issuecomment-1653699397
- "admin" name is hardcoded at some places in OpenStack and thus bypasses role definition
- Domain-admin role thus MUST NOT be named "admin"
- Role definitions worked out by @markus-hentsch
    - Implemented via policy settings
    - Roles (e.g. member) can be assigned to users 
    - Groups not yet covered, could be added in a straight-forward way
    - Role definitions NOT changeable by domain-admin, hard to do correctly
      - allowing tenants to create custom roles is dangerous
      - also requires deep changes in the policies that would be globally and statically defined
      - standard roles should be predefined by SCS (inspired by Yoga work)
    - Concept has been implemented, Pentesting yet to be done
- OpenStack limitation: All domains are visible, all roles are visible
    - domain scope not honored by all APIs, leaking data that should not be visible to customer
    - would require code changes/fixes
- AI @garloff, @markus-hentsch: Create user-stories to structure the work
    - Connect to public cloud sig, IAM team, OTC
    - IAM hacking session Fri 10:05

### OvS to OVN
#### Work in progress @ wavecon
- Document what challenges are found
    - Upstream guide may be incomplete
    - Existing workloads are affected due to encapsulation changes
    - Assessment of complete impact
- Blog article wanted
- OvS -> OVN migrations are highly relevant for brownfield setups

### Upgrade policies
- SCS wants upgrades within 6 weeks
- Need to find ways to make this happen
- Leave space open for "LTS enterprise" support packages against €€€

### OVN VPNaaS
- Must-have from @flyersa perspective (for enterprise/private SCS clouds)
- OVN allows using legacy implementation
- Modern DH groups missing (independent from OVN) 14 vs 22
- VPNaaS via OVN would be nicer, but not yet as mature (maybe incomplete)
- Not yet an official SCS feature, no test coverage -> AI discuss, possibly add to scope

### API Defaults for Workersize
- Sizing of API servers
- Defaults (from kolla) not big enough for larger environments?
- AI @flyersa: Collect input and push plusserver to report

### Report sync OSISM-VexxHost
* Magnum/Cluster-API
    * integration from VexxHost/StackHPC upstream
* shared use/build of k8s-capi-images + CI
    * join forces
* idea of having a baseline for OpenStack service images
    * atmosphere inspired -> common base for service-specific kolla-images
* Keycloak integration in Keystone (https://github.com/vexxhost/keystone-keycloak-backend)
    * -> IAM team / compare with current approach
    * Need to ensure longterm sustainability
* Invite MNaser for a lightning talk or deep dive?
