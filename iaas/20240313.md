## Housekeeping & Organizational Items

- Report in the community call by: @artificial-intelligence
- Responsible for the minutes (writing and transfer to github): @fkr

- Heads-Up: @fkr will be on PTO the next couple weeks


## Agenda

### R6 - last call for items that need to be discussed here (@fkr)

* Release of 7.0.0d (RC3) because of OVN 24.03.1?
    * PS can test it, so we'll produce it tonight

### Security Advisory OVN

* Will be published in the next couple days - _AI_: @fkr

### Domain Manager role/persona (@markus-hentsch)

~ 5-10 Minutes

- context: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/384#issuecomment-1988579714
- TL;DR:
    - upstream does not want to introduce `domain-manager` role but asks us to re-use `manager` in a domain-scoped fashion as a *Domain Manager Persona* instead
    - upstream will not finish RBAC rework (that provides `manager` role) any time soon (requirement for the new persona)
    - currently, our SCS standard draft introduces new `domain-manager` role specific to SCS
- proposal: change our standard draft to rename `domain-manager` -> `manager` instead and transfer the Domain Manager policies to it (= minor change to the standard)
    - this way we would be future-proof: we can introduce Domain Manager now and whenever upstream is finished, the role name and behavior doesn't change, just the implementation under the hood and the extensions from upstream are added, making the role useful in other scopes later on
- discuss removal of the policy in osism/testbed & osism/cloud-in-a-box: https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/912
- Decisions:
    - Do the rename?
        - YES
    - This is a draft currently, not yet recommended for production
        - https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0302-v1-domain-manager-role
        - Implementation exists
        - Expect this to match upstream development
    - Stabilization PR next
    - Making it part of a SCS-compatible certification requirement is a separate discussion

### Keystone token security (@markus-hentsch)

~ 10-15 Minutes

- [Issue](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/568)
- **Fernet** vs. **JWS**, https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest//admin/tokens-overview.html#token-providers
    - **JWS** = only signed not encrypted, requires no key replication in Keystone
        - each Keystone server has individual signing key pair, rotated individually
    - **Fernet** = encrypted, persistent and the decyption keys are replicated between Keystone instances
        - all Keystone servers share the key repository, key rotation has to be done in sync; secondary and staged keys ensure transition timeframe
- each backend has different deployment and lifecycle procedures (changing token provider is more than just changing config options!)
- JWS is the more modern standard and more widely adopted in other frameworks
    - e.g. Ceph can use also use JWS tokens in S3 auth

Disadvantages of Fernet:

- Fernet *spec* largely abandoned, not recognized by a standards body = no close auditing like with IETF standards, fixing CVEs is up to the OpenStack community ([source](https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/keystone-specs/specs/keystone/stein/json-web-tokens.html#problem-description))
    - clarification: Fernet crypto implementation is part of [python-cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/) and better maintained than the Fernet *spec*; e.g. spec is stuck at AES-128, meaning that the implementation is limited to it
- if multiple Keystones nodes: symmetric keys need to physically leave a Keystone node during rotation for distribution (with JWS: private keys stay on nodes, only public keys are distributed)

The [docs say](https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/admin/tokens-overview.html#jws-tokens):

> "A deployment might consider using JWS tokens as opposed to fernet tokens if there are security concerns about sharing symmetric encryption keys across hosts. Note that a major difference between the two providers is that JWS tokens are not opaque and can be decoded by anyone with the token ID. Fernet tokens are opaque in that the token ID is ciphertext."

Questions:

- Q: how are tokens handled in federated setups?
    - Markus: I've seen "unscoped token" being mentioned
- Q: do we currently limit token providers? do we need to make any recommendations?

- Q: is a migration/change from fernet to jws possible? how?

- Something to have in mind in hinsight of R7?
    - in the course of R7 cycle switch default to JWS?
    - needs proper testing (as this is not the current default)
    - @horazont warns about long-running tasks that use tokens in regards to upgrade scenarios - in which (due to switching from fernet to JWS) the tokens would be invalidated


### Classification of SCS-supported OpenStack components and services (@JosephineSei, @markus-hentsch)

~ 10-15 Minutes

- https://input.scs.community/list-of-required-recommended-and-optional-openstack-projects
    - Issue [issues#528](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/528)
- call for action: if you spot anything under the "unsupported" category that you see a need for, please drop comment in issue or move it between lists
- likewise: Add your name(github handle) to provide input
- Finalize this in the overflow Slot 18th March (15:05 CET) - _AI_: @fkr to schedule this in the calendar

### Ceph Mon Backups (@poelzi)

- 10-15 Minutes
- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/529
- https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/63801

- Mon connection required for keys to recover database with encrypted disks
    - Restoration process with somewhat dated[1] database backup works: backup allows OSD to boot (with encryption), updates will then be scanned for in the cluster until the most recent state has been found and cluster turns into OK state
        - [1] Backup should be no older than the point in time when the last OSD joined, trigger added by @poelzi
- Outline of the ceph mon backup functionality that is being built by @poelzi
- How should this be integrated into OSISM once finished? How is the workflow for operators with this?

### Decision needed for the Security Group (@JosephineSei)

- 5-10 Minutes
- Standard or Documentation
    - Standard would need `network rbac create` - that has severe downsides
    - @markus-hentsch, @josephineSei, @anjastrunk prefer documentation
- DR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/495
- First Documentation Draft: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/142
