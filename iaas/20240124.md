## Agenda

:rotating_light: When adding items to the agenda, please note:

- Please note your handle
- Please note the amount of time the topic needs in order to be discussed adequately
- If your topic requires certain people from our community to be around, please make sure they're present for the meeting

### VP04 - Cloud interconnectivity

- A meeting with Tellus (https://www.tellus-project.de) is being arranged to discuss the cloud interconnectivity.

### Update on ceph deployment and Day-2-operations tooling (@fkr & B1 colleagues)
- 10 Mins
- Looking for people with experience with cephadm
- Keystone is not yet connected to rook - needs to be addressed (as it would be a regression for existing customers)
- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/515 (issue for feedback/input provided by users)
- https://input.scs.community/Pp1KtKn0TWegje2KYPA-_A#OSISM-features-vs-native-features (hedgedoc with a lot of information about Rook, cephadm, ..)

### Ceph Deployment Meeting Notes (@boekhorstb1)

- Question: should we test cephadm in Kubernetes?
- Data Migration Issues with Rook [example](https://github.com/rook/rook/discussions/12045)
    - Does this need testing?
    - Should we consider this a blocker?
    - For production setup this is a need
        - @frosty-geek: it is a must for plusserver
        - Possible solution could be a mirroring setup? - propably no see below
        - @fkr: propably we want a simple upgrade path without need for duplicate infra
        - @garloff
            - we need a stable and simple upgrade path for clouds that move from the old (cephadm) to the new (rook?) reference implementation
                - without downtime
                - without massive extra hardware
            - The issue with connection to keystone is a major stepback as this prevents users from using rados GW easily with tokens (or ec2-style creds) from keystone
    - Uhurutec and Cloud&Heat working on Keystone and RGW connection
    - Rook is planing to implement the connection with Keystone
    - live/online take over/migration of existing clusters (it will not be possible to shutoff running payload for most (all) users) (@berendt)
- Cephadm running in kubernetes?
    - @berendt: No need it needs to just run somewhere
- Data migration (need to define the term migration for scs)
    - Wavestack cephadm
        - @garloff: Migration for someone not using reference implementation solution for ceph does not need to be supported but is a nice to have
    - Pluserver + OSISM deployed with ceph ansible
        - The reference implementation needs to be fully supported for the upgrade path
    - Needs to be online / in place / zero downtime migration
    - We can not change the FSid or IPs of the cluster
    - @frosty-geek: Would be nice to have the ability for the admin to choose a batch of volumes to be migrated at once (and manually trigger it) to fully customize the migration cadence based on the setup
- A separate meeting wil be held to define the requirements of the migration

### K8s CSI Encryption (@NotTheEvilOne)

- 2 Mins
- https://input.scs.community/9FbrLgYbT8KFvZGXLzay6Q?both#cryptsetup2
- Updates to the current possible implementation
- Question about focus of secret handling
- Is it possible to implement encryption with customer provided key using barbican (BYOK)
    - Ralph suggestion: Properly implement it upstream for Openstack
        - @fkr
            - would be propably the correct approach
            - SCS has enough experience to support this effort
    - Currently not technically possible without changes upstream
    - Using barbican generated keys is working
    - Secustack was maybe looking into this?
- We need an encrypted storage layer for KaaS and IaaS therefore we need to implement a place for customers to store their keys
- @josephine: Point of contact for the upstream barbican team
    - After that to present it on the vPTG 
- This is mostly working already with barbican but the "key needs to be predefined at the time of the volume creation"
    -  Openstack Community should request the Feature/Fix and we should do the PR ourselves (so: @Tobias will continue working upstream)
 - Next step present it on the next barbican meeting Mondays 15:00 UTC (
https://meetings.opendev.org/#Barbican_Meeting)

### Public cloud sig
Wed 9:00 CET, please join. https://meetings.opendev.org/#Public_Cloud_SIG_Meeting

- Do you operate a public cloud or your colleagues do? Plese join.
- We want to not limit the members to operators of just SCS
