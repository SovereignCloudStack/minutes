## Agenda

### R5 (6.0.0) highlights collection
Input from brainstorming in PB:

- k8s on management/control plane (can host extensions, also k8s-capi) - implemented with k3s for now (medium-term: yaook-core planned)
    - internal
    - yaook core split ongoing since a few weeks now
        - feedback wanted (https://gitlab.com/yaook/meta#subscribe-to-meetings, https://meet.cloudandheat.com/shoreleave, Thu 14:30 CEST)
- resource manager to track erroneous/orphan resources
    - @matfechner to collect knowledge
- WIP: bare metal without PXE (not yet integrated)
- IPv6 east-west and north-south (Test-coverage? IPv6-FIPs? Provider-Net? @osfrickler)
    - @matfechner to bring it back to OSISM

Questions:

- Are these ready? Documented and tested?
- What other highlights?
- Anything else in need of focus for R5?

### Hashicorp's move to BSL
- Blog article planned (@garloff)
- Assess precise exposure in IaaS layer: terraform and vault
    - OSISM (tf+vault)
        - tf only in testbed
        - vault currently optional for keeping secrets
    - k8s-cluster-api-provider (tf)
    - yaook core (vault)
- Stick to free versions for now
- Medium-term: Move to free forks (and possibly contribute) and/or change technology?
    - vault is a lot more difficult to replace (it has a large responsibility as well)

### Enterprise Support from Canonical
- Holding back security updates in Canonical/Ubuntu Repository esm-infra ? -> discuss dependency?
- Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM) vs. Community, best efforts patches

### Standardize image names and source URLs [standards/#326](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/326)

Questions to discuss:

- Which images really need to be mandatory?
    - Kubernetes CAPI images
        - Are we talking about those: <https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/blob/main/etc/images/kubernetes.yml>
        - But then do we really want to mandate `minio.services.osism.tech` URLs?
        - In general, do we want to include multiple versions?
        - Make this a non-mandatory recommendation (as the k8s-capi scripts do download and register this on the fly if non-present)
    - Ubuntu 22.04
        - Currently required for the CAPI management host, BUT that image could also be built upon Debian
            - Do this (-> add Debian STABLE)
        - And maybe we should do so (according to personal communication with @berendt)
- How does the upload/quota mechanism work with Glance? What quota would be reasonable?
    - maybe start with at least 200 GB (and 40 images)
- How does the yaml tie in with the image manager? Can it be a subset?

### Split flavor naming and mandatory flavors in two separate standards [standards/#267](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/267)

- please do [review PR 319](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/319)!
- most importantly <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/issue/267/Standards/scs-0103-v1-standard-flavors.md>
- note: the flavor manager has to be extended to support and handle the extra_specs properties!

### Define Standard for the naming of volume types [standards/#265](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/265)

- Please [review PR 323](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/323)

### Blog article on CPU vulns
- [Describing](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/blob/feat/blog-cpu-vuln-202308/_i18n/en/_posts/blog/2023-08-16-new-cpu-leaks.md) issues, risks, mitigations
- Still looking for an Operator to fill in practical information on patching

### Mid-sprint exchange
[Sprint board](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/4)

### Revise flavor naming standard according to review criticism [standards/#327](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/327) 

[Possible editorial improvements](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/327#issuecomment-1679610549) of the flavor naming standard to discuss:

- Remove two flavor name examples marked FIXME (by @tibeer), as already suggested by @garloff.
- Drop the sentence about smooth transition from v1 to v2 as it's kind of historic?
- Regarding the possibility to grant exceptions for missing flavors
    - maybe clarify that this intention is in no way authoritative but a potential future avenue for those providers who cannot comply with these terms
    - maybe mention that this would require a dedicated ADR/standard document and maybe even a separate type of certificate (instead of _SCS-compatible IaaS_, _SCS-compatible IaaS for edge computing_)?
- As for the suffix `i`: Maybe we can make the wording more clear regarding the **commitment** to implement all mitigations **IF and WHEN** they exist.

All this can be implemented (by @mbuechse) within this issue and this sprint.
