## Agenda

### Availability Zone Standard (@josephineSei)

- first draft of Standard, still with some open questions: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/640
- tl;dr:
    - Compute Availability Zone MUST be (at least) in different fire protection zones.
    - Availabilty Zones for Storage SHOULD be setup, if there is no storage backend used that can span over different fire zones and automatically replicate the data.
    - Nothing about network AZs
        - it has been brought up that it is hard to configure and not nice to use for users
        - @garloff: discourage or even forbid usage of network AZs
            - @berendt: should not be forbidden, there are use cases
        - These are really not nice for users, we should discourage it (but not disallow)
            - ToDo (@josephineSei): Ask for more use cases, maybe we can not even discourage
    - ...
- open question about cross attaching volumes to other compute AZ:
    - If Availability Zones for Storage are used, SHOULD the attaching of volumes from one Storage Availability Zone to another Compute Availability Zone (cross-attach) be allowed / encouraged / forbidden / other?
        - so far, nearly no CSP uses this according to Hedgedoc input
        - @garloff: unlike for network it is not obvious that I can attach volumes from other AZs
        - when using Ceph, you'd normally have a global cross-AZ for storage (but not several storage AZs)
        - if not using Ceph, implementation would be hard, we should not request this from CSPs
            - Use-case wavecon: Local dedicated (per AZ) ceph clusters, no support for x-attaching
        - @artificial-intelligence: X-attach would negatively impact isolation between AZs (and performance)
    - Maybe transparency is the most important feature here?
    - important to distinguish between replicating storage between AZs vs. cross-attaching volumes across AZs
- When reaching out to get more input from providers, we should also look in the larger OpenInfra space
- @frosty-geek: Trouble is that fire protection zones may not be as helpful as users expect
- We can not define all kinds of details how DCs should be built for highest availability
    - Reference DC taxonomies / BSI taxonomy for this
    - SCS can be useful by providing some minimal bounds that allows uses to have meaningfully higher chance to survive by spreading over several AZs
    - Highest level of redundancy will always be achieved by replicating data over several regions
        - Can we define something with "AZ"s that's better than nothing (though never as good as regions)?

### Generally allow `scs:name-vN` extra specs (@mbuechse)

- see [standards/#574](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/574) and [standards/#594](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/594)
    - We have agreement that this should be allowed (assuming the naming rules are followed, of course)
- open to discuss:
    - can multiple flavors have the same value for `scs:name-vN`?
        - Downside: Several matches may not be handled very well by IaC tools
        - Motivation: Several matches are valid
    - do we want to allow multiple property values for the same flavor?
- Side-discussion: API does not currently support (server-side) filtering for extra_specs, would need to be done in the client
    - Discoverability service (public cloud SIG) would solve this
    - Intermediate state with extra_specs is not yet useful without the discoverablity service nor the API filter capability
        - No user benefit *yet*
            - except those that use some specific code in opentofu or use the SDK anyway and use the additional information there
        - but also: negligible cost
            - Adding extra_specs to an existing flavors does not change the UUID nor the behavior, requires no downtime and won't be noticed by running VMs ...
                - @gtema: Need to make sure to not conflict with existing values used by nova/placement, so using a prefix `scs:` is really needed to stay out of danger
