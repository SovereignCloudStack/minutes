### Sprint Review & Planning - (25 Minutes)

#### Wrapping up Disk Encryption Discussion

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/33>
* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/30>

Blog post covers it all, reference it for questions!

#### Validations

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/28>
  * RGW validator needs to be moved to R5 (-> new story)
  * Most pieces ready for R4, Release Notes should be expanded

#### Cloud-in-a-Box

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/116>

* Open Question: Upgrade Path or not to Upgrade Path?
  * <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/276>
  * Avoid significant extra effort, link to testbed

* Blog post (WIP): <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/pull/544>
  (publish before R4!)

#### ADR IaaS RNG

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/234>
* Next steps: Merge  and then stabilize

#### Air-Gapped Part 1 - Mirroring (at OSISM)

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/90>
  * osism/issues#88 -> DONE
  * APT (.deb pkgs) is still missing (left out for now)
    * goal is to complete this for R4

#### Air-Gapped Part 2 - Docs & Tooling how to set up mirrors

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/280>
  * osism/issues#408 -> DONE
  * Testbed: Manager Docker Daemon is about to be switched to the osism mirror
  * Testbed: Node Docker Daemons are still missing
  * Testbed: PyPi, Ansible-Galaxy and APT still missing
* Complete this past R4 (R4.x / v5.x)
* Breakout to clarify R4 and past-R4 scope (@fkr)

#### LBaaS Research L3

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/251>
  * Done
* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/268>
  * Health-Mon FIP bug possibly solved in zed?
  * Need HTTP Health-Mon for k8s (or enhance OCCM to allow setting TCP health-mon) -> R5

#### Metrics-collection IaaS

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/269>

* <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/237>

* Challenge: Ceph object storage backend will struggle with lots of small objects after a longer time. Alternatives: For incoming data: File storage? Redis?
  * Needs to be addressed medium-term, not in the early phase of the project
  * Data aggregation, less polling may avoid so many small objects
  * Avoid setting up ceph in testbed for this now?
  * Gnocchi recommendation: <https://gnocchi.osci.io/intro.html#incoming-and-storage-drivers>
    * Redis for incoming data, ceph for aggregate storage
  * Breakout session: Overflow (Mon 15:05 CET) in the next weeks

#### IaaS Flavor Names

* Discuss on 2023-03-15
* Prepare with concrete proposals
  * @garloff: v2 proposal with transition plan
  * @fkr: metadata driven approach

#### IaaS Shared Filesystem as a Service

* Manila with cephfs/nfs
  * Available in kolla, needs integration work (for R5)
  * Needed for k8s RWX (but also other requests)
  * AI: @fkr and @matfechner will write the epic & stories
