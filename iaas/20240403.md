- Sign up for the Hackathon#4! https://input.scs.community/Hy0HqULMTGeeVIcy0vmBgA


## Agenda

### VP04 - Work on redis TLS (@berendt)

- 5 Minutes
- Discussion in preparation for this IaaS call between @berendt and @fkr
- Especially in regard to the question wether to wait with further work until more clarity or not (see https://matrix.to/#/!xlFjWCAoQenuOeIVQw:matrix.org/$bQQV6plYBcJ6074f4Y5iNgD5imdkrLmFNZlhzTI7Hcg?via=matrix.org)
- Conclusion:
    - since the TLS work does not touch any core-parts of redis and is mostly client-facing/client-side it can be continued. Since when switching to a fork this will likely be very much the same for now
    - We expect an Opensource fork to appear in the near future and replace redis
    - We also expect the redis SDK to stay open source 
    - We will wait for upstream to elect a fork, this will not be addressed by SCS

### VP01 - Work on the VMware ESXi migration guide (@belgeron, @varkeen)

- 5 Minutes
- current state:
    - initial release of a guide to migrate a small vm to Openstack 
    - In progress: small python script
        - Little bit of automation without needing to know the background just with access to Openstack
        - Import of the VM is already working
- Migration guide in progress - simple step by step for standed ESXi deployments
- Will be published soon in the docs repo    https://github.com/osism/osism.github.io/pull/403


### VP01 - CentOS/Debian support (@berendt, @gndrmnn)

current state:
- Common ansible collection compatible
- CI tests are already running
- Not tested on production
- There will be debian nodes in the SCS labs
- CentOS will be supported in testbed
- Possibility to have a mix of distribution on nodes

Testers needed. Please reach out to @berendt if you want to be early adopter.
### VP01 - ARM support (@berendt)

next steps:
- ARM flavours for ubuntu not best suitable
- We want to prefer Debian for ARM nodes
- We are preparing OSISM node image for debian
- We also want to build container images for services
- We focus only on supporting ARM nodes for compute nodes
- That means that services running on control plane like rabbitmq won't have images for ARMs
- improved CI pipeline, be able to build individual images

### VP18 - SCS Lab (@scoopex)

- current state:
    - the progress of VP18 has blocked for a very long time due to dependencies and problems that were beyond the control of engineering
    - the hardware deployment and all hardware the cabling is complete
    - acceptance process with the data center service provider is in progress to establish offical productive operation mode
      (comparison of the current state with the contract documents, on-site appointment at the data center, ...)
    - the deployment of the first scs-system is in progress
    - automation of physical deployment
    - transferral of the [interim documentation](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/system-landscape) to the [public Github repo](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/hardware-landscape) is still in progress
    - Christian and Jens have transferred a existing Layer 3 routing setup to the production area of the environment using Enterprise SONiC
- in the next two weeks:
    - establishment of routing areas/setup for the separation of environments, storage and compute nodes and establishment of internet access via proxy
    - deployment of the initial SCS test setup
    - migrate interrim JH-Jumphost to our own hardware using Ansible
      (Internet access, SSH login, VPN, proxy, firewall and DHCP)
    - setup the first working SCS environment
- in the next 6 weeks:
    - routing of the official /24 IP block to the SCS environment
    - migration of the enterprise SONiC network setup to the SCS SONiC builds (conversion to frr-mgmt-framework if necessary)
    - step-by-step demolition and rebuilding of environments to optimize deployment
    - setup of Keycloak for Identity Brokering with the SCS UCS system
    - deployment of the observability stack (Prometheus, Opensearch)
    - establish hardware monitoring, node/os monitoring, network monitoring
    
### VP10 - User Data Backup (@markus-hentsch)

- Issue: [standards#541](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/541)
- user data = "data uploaded to / generated in the IaaS minus in-transit/in-use data (network, RAM etc.) - focused on data-at-rest
- I as a user want to know how my data is being backuped or I want to setup my own backup solution
- current user data classification (Selected resources for backup):
    - Glance images
    - Cinder volumes
    - Nova Ephemeral Storage disks
    - Barbican keys
    - @berendt: user data supplied to Nova VMs as configuration/script?
        - Way to establish backup of this data is yet to be discovered 
- backup responsibility
    - **CSP**: redundancy / automated backups
        - Q: what can SCS standardize here?
            - Standards
            - Redundancy
            - Recomendations / Mandation
            - Looking for input
        - Q: should Cinder Backup service be part of the SCS standards?
            - needs Swift, NFS or similar as backend
            - User can also trigger Cinder backups manually
            - Should this be part of the required services for SCS?
            - Does someone use Cinder backup?
                - @berendt - Cinder backup enabled by default in OSISM
    - **customer/user**: selective backups using API functions
        - example: images from volumes, image download
        - SCS can provide documentation about ...
            - ... how is my data stored?
            - ... how can I backup my data?
- for user/customer side a backup guide has been created
    - docs PR: [docs#176](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/176)
- Q: side question, where are Barbican policies defined for the reference setup? (do they support simple members to manage secrets yet?)

- Q: Do we need an end user section?

### VP10 - IPv4/IPv6 Standardization - Breakout session (cah-patrickthiem)

- planned for next week - 11.04.24 - 14:05-14:55
- in depth discussion and sync regarding IPv4 and IPv6 standardization
- calendar PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/calendar/pull/265
