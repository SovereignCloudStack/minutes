## Agenda

### List of SCS-supported OpenStack components (@josephineSei, @markus-hentsch)

- up to 30 Minutes to allow proper discussion

Issue: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/528

Current list: https://input.scs.community/list-of-required-recommended-and-optional-openstack-projects#

- we received some CSP/operator feedback on the list since writing to the mailing list and @fkr forwarding it (thanks @fkr!)
    - we are looking at components (functionality) as a whole and their behavior and interfaces (APIs)
        - Standards do require the ref.impl. to deliver the functionality and interfaces
        - OpenStack differentiates between API (e.g. "Networking API") and reference implementation (e.g. "Neutron")
            - we should only refer to the functionality and their API when talking standards
- updates
    - Octavia upgraded to mandatory (due to KaaS reference implementation)
    - Manila upgraded to supported on popular request
    - Masakari upgraded to supported on popular request
- open questions
    - Senlin requested but not yet put from unsupported into supported; utilizes some other services in its API objects that may be part of supported or unsupported only
        - e.g. [stack profile](https://docs.openstack.org/senlin/latest/user/profile_types/stack.html) needs Heat API
        - users might expect everything to work / to be available?
        - no PTL for senlin, is that a problem or something we can cope with? How do we deal with that?
        - [senlin is marked "inactive" upstream](https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/emerging-technology-and-inactive-projects.html#current-inactive-projects) so there is e.g. no one dealing with security issues
        - no alternative to Senlin for highly available VMs!
        - other technologies who can handle highly-available solutions could be proposed (like masakari)
        - => Meeting tomorrow where the requirements / use cases for VM HA are being collected and documented
    - make sure that mandatory components are available in OSISM  
    - indepth discussion on S3 and Swift APIs
        - proposal to make S3 API mandatory, since this was previously communicated
