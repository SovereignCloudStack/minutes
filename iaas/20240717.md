### Domain Manager (@markus-hentsch)

- upstream spec has been merged! :rocket:
- implementation has started: <https://review.opendev.org/q/topic:%22domain-manager%22>
  - Keystone implementation (policies) mostly done
  - SCS standard compliance tests are passing
  - more Tempest tests may need to be added
    - first skeletons added

### Key-Manager Spec (@josephineSei)

- working on tests
  - interconnection with the roles (SRBAC) topic
  - current Barbican used roles are not known by Keystone
    - SRBAC in keystone vs old RBAC in barbican does not work nicely
  - 2024.2 (Dalmatian) will use SRBAC all over the place
    - SCS R8 (3/2025)
    - Challenges for swift and masakari, cloudkitty, gnocchi?
      - No SCS provider uses swift (but radosgw instead)
      - cloudkitty, gnocchi are focused on operators
      - masakari not currently used (but considered for VM HA)

### Specs for image encryption merged upstream
