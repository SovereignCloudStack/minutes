### Domain Manager (@markus-hentsch)

- upstream spec has been merged! :rocket:
- implementation has started: https://review.opendev.org/q/topic:%22domain-manager%22
    - Keystone implementation (policies) mostly done
    - SCS standard compliance tests are passing
    - more Tempest tests may need to be added
        - first skeletons added

### Key-Manager Spec (@josephineSei)

- working on tests
    - interconnection with the roles (SRBAC) topic
    - current Barbican used roles are not known by Keystone
        - SRBAC in keystone vs old RBAC in barbican does not work nicely
    - 2024.2 (Dalmatian) will use SRBAC all over the place
        - SCS R8 (3/2025)
        - Challenges for swift and masakari, cloudkitty, gnocchi?
            - No SCS provider uses swift (but radosgw instead)
            - cloudkitty, gnocchi are focused on operators
            - masakari not currently used (but considered for VM HA)

### Specs for image encryption merged upstream

- merged upstream

### Volumetype metadata spec merged
