## Agenda

### Need for Manila (@gtema)

Typical Kubernetes usage pattern is to have a single PVC/PV shared between different pods. And since also typically K8 worker nodes are distributed across AZs it is required to have a storage that can be attached in different AZs. Usually (with OpenStack in mind) this is relying on Manila which we do not have as of now. Possibility to cross attach Cinder volumes across AZs (together with multiattach) is also not present by default.
- Cross-AZ use case is an unusual motivation for manila
  - The recommended way to achieve it is by having ceph being global (per region) and distributing the OSDs such that the replicas ensure survival of an AZ outage
- Typically we hear it to support read-write-many (RWX) attachments (for containers)
  - cinder (cross-AZ) multi-attach would require a cluster filesystem (e.g. ocfs, GFS, glusterFS)
    - Complex
  - manila with cephfs or NFS-Ganesha
    - cephfs: Need direct network access to it
      - Low-latency access needed for good performance
    - Ganesha-NFS: Tricky to get HA working well
      - Limited performance expectations
    - Non-standard options to look at
      - Lizard-FS:
        - <https://lizardfs.com>, <https://github.com/lizardfs/lizardfs>
                  (last release published on github in december 2017)
        - check needed if its (still) real opensource
        - can run on top of local volumes and uses its only replication/high availability mechanism
      - AndrewFS
        - used by openDev
        - does not seem to be well maintained though
  - RWX requirement comes up again and again
    - above 50% of PSKE customers would like it
    - Having Manila would also help with attaching external high-perf specialized solutions
    - HA is required, otherwise not useful for production
- Way forward:
  - Investigate options to provide manila (in a HA manner)
  - Trade complexity off against not having the feature

### Flavor naming standard v4 - GPU flavor naming refinement (@cah-patrickthiem)

- issue: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/366>
- PR: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/546>
  - reminder: call for feedback on the comments in the PR

### Fallout from last recent CVE (@garloff, 5min)

- [CVE-2024-40767](https://scs.community/security/2024/07/23/cve-2024-40767/)
- failed to exploit this time with default configuration
- polished procedure of dealing with CVEs, installation with smooth

### Test feedback (@flyersa)

- both upgrade and greenfield tested
- Tested OSISM 7 with 2024.1 (Caracal) on top
  - only minor issues found, already addressed by OSISM
    - memcache and horizon
    - no more custom local settings in horizon -> needs to be mentioned in release notes
- ovn VPN aaS backported now into 2024.1
  - only old PFS IPsec groups supported in
    - ongoing work upstream
- Backup restore from data volume issue fixed (cinder) - also fixed in 7.0.5 also
- magnum with cilium supported now (vexxhost patches)
- there is a work on automating testing
