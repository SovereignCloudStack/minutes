## Agenda

### Sprint Review & Planning
https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/4

* [#124](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/124) OSISM documentation - https://osism.github.io/docs/intro/ built from https://github.com/osism/osism.github.io
    * Old page https://docs.osism.tech/ **is no longer up-to-date** !
* Domain manager role [#184](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/184)
    * Hiding domain list has been accepted conceptually, patch from Markus in upstream review (had to fix tempest tests) [#446](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/446)
    * Broader concept still in upstream discussion
    * Horizon may have additional challenges
* Volume types [#265](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/265)
    * Open: Do we need to define the ordering of properties?
        * AI @garloff, @anjastrunk to provide feedback
    * Feedback from @akafazov pending


#### Confidential Computing (VP01)
* #39, [#42](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/42), PR [website/#773](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/pull/773) - Tech overview and blog post
* [#246](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/246) - Forward port of patches to OpenStack
* SCS CiaB hardware have AMD SEV support, look at it next

#### VP04 items
* Lot 1 - SDN scalability
    * Network design discussion - [hedgedoc](https://input.scs.community/VP04-issues-455-research-SDN-scalability)
    * Next Mon (2023-11-20) overflow slot 15:05 CET: Detailed discussion on SDN scalability
    * Blogpost plan
* Input from PS desirable
    * PS not (yet?) hitting scalability limits of OVN
    * @flyersa reports on a bug in OVN that was fixed for R4.1 (OSISM 5.1.0)
* To build custom SONIC images or not?
    * Custom images work, but bugs needs to be addressed (though that also applies to Enterprise SONIC images)
        * Bugfixes, hardened, support in Enterprise images
        * No big difference in features
    * Focus on 100G switches for custom SONIC images for now
        * (They are very similar in price.)
    * Go/No-Go for custom images by x-mas
    * Full Control-Plane offloading to Switches (OVN controller) can only be done with custom SONIC
    * Dataplane offloading works regardless of enterprise vs custom image (with Smart-NICs)
* Lot 2 - network encryption
    * Epic on OpenStack services
    * User stories on VM to VM encryption
* Lot 3 - x-cross connectivity
    * Ideas, no development started yet

#### VP13 metering
* [#269](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/269) - finishing up documentation (@mbuechse)

### Re-Cap of priorization session IaaS Standards (@fkr)
* [#285](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/285)
-> Invitiation for next week (not Wed)
-> List of things to standardize and in which order
* Next SIG std/cert on Nov 23

* Standards testing via zuul [#316](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/316)
    * zuul works again, will get first results today
    * More cloud environments TBD (AppCreds from @garloff -> @mbuechse)
    * WIP: Displaying compliance status on a web page

### Who is using Clevis-Tang based encryption of storage? (@fkr)
- https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/751
- Needed for BSI C5?
- Encrypting storage used on the hosts (with keys owned by the operators)
- Blog post: https://scs.community/2022/08/17/osism-nbde-install/
- Not yet used in production, although wavestack has plans

### Report from docs session on hackathon
- Operator docs intro rewritten
- "SCS developer" may not be an ideal term
