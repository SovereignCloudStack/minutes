## Recurring items
* Who is presenting in weekly community call and transforming etherpad
   to minutes in GitHub? @matfechner

* Anything else to add to the agenda?

* Housekeeping
* [Zuul for SCS: all definitions clear?](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/157#issuecomment-1286898429)

* Make zuul head node larger for flexibility, otherwise proceed as planned

* Ephemeral Storage epic was still missing @fkr @matfechner - [done](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/200),
  work on it, starting next sprint, work on ADR before if possible.

## Agenda

### Intro Paul-Philipp Kuschy - new employee @ OSISM, focused on ceph
* R4 will see an updated ceph version, upgrade tests in CI, validate results
* Support TSI BMS deployments

### [Anything urgent on OpenSSL-3 issue](https://scs.community/security/2022/11/01/advisory-spookyssl/) ?
* Ubuntu 22.04 images are used in management plane (OSISM), low exposure
  (not consuming external certs)
* OSISM v4.1.0 will be cut, rebuild, release notes contain update instructions
* While not strictly required for OpenSSL security reasons, it is something we
  want to do routinely

### OpenStack Image Manager

Why not use todays session to look into the openstack image manager together.
Someone who is NOT from osism should be in the drivers seat.
* Simon working on it: Add needed metadata
* Use existing tool to check conformance
* Image Metadata in SCS clouds should come from there
* Goal to reach compliance by 2022-10-31 not achieved
* Timeline for image-manager (if moving forward straight-forward)-> January
=> Decide in PB:
     (1) Implement standard later (after Jan)
     (2) Speed-up image-manager development
     (3) Ask providers to use a script to amend missing metadata short-term
