## Agenda

### Intro Paul-Philipp Kuschy - new employee @ OSISM, focused on ceph
- R4 will see an updated ceph version, upgrade tests in CI, validate results
- Support TSI BMS deployments

### [Anything urgent on OpenSSL-3 issue](https://scs.community/security/2022/11/01/advisory-spookyssl/) ?
- Ubuntu 22.04 images are used in management plane (OSISM), low exposure 
  (not consuming external certs)
- OSISM v4.1.0 will be cut, rebuild, release notes contain update instructions
- While not strictly required for OpenSSL security reasons, it is something we 
  want to do routinely

### OpenStack Image Manager

Why not use todays session to look into the openstack image manager together.
Someone who is NOT from osism should be in the drivers seat.
- Simon working on it: Add needed metadata
- Use existing tool to check conformance
- Image Metadata in SCS clouds should come from there
- Goal to reach compliance by 2022-10-31 not achieved
- Timeline for image-manager (if moving forward straight-forward)-> January
=> Decide in PB:
     (1) Implement standard later (after Jan)
     (2) Speed-up image-manager development
     (3) Ask providers to use a script to amend missing metadata short-term
