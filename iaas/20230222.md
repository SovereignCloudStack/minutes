## Agenda

### Pending ADRs

  [SCS/PR#198](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/198)

  * Nothing to consider from the IaaS perspective -> finalize quickly in 
    Container Team next Mon

   [SCS/PR#199](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/199)

    * Where are we w.r.t. flavors with local SSDs? Mandatory for R4?
    * Standard feature of OpenStack, works
    * Already existing in wavestack (NVMe)
    * PS not yet clear whether this can be done by April, many other activities (
      related to growth)
      - Committed to implement this, timeline before R4 not yet safe
      - Need to wait for a few more weeks before we can finalize the timeline

   [SCS/standards#PR226](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/226)
    * Has been merged ... but how to make the transition smooth?
      - e.g. Flavor aliases, see PoC [SCS/standards#PR226](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/228) 
      - huge impact on providers
      - migration time for customers will be many months (8+)
    * Fundamental discussion: Usefulness of flavor naming spec
      - The 26 mandatory flavors are not covering enough, thus optional
        flavors will beused
    * These need to be tested for / discovered anyway when moving workloads
      between clouds
       - Cost of transition may outweigh usefulness of standardization
    * Discoverability spec needs prioritization
    * Standardizing systematic naming may become optional?
    * Mandatory flavor list may become optional?
    * More discussion needed, Hackathon, Action Item *@jschoone*, add to 
      topic collection there

### Does it makes sense to enforce the use of at least 2 DNS name servers
   [osism/issues#309](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/309)
    * Stop enforcing it, but mention recommendation in release notes

### Evaluate magnum-cluster-api [osism/issues#436](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/436)(also related to Team CAAS)
   * Discuss in container team
