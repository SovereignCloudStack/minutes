## Agenda

### Standardize minimum version of Software in the IaaS Layer (@josephineSei)

PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/765
tl;dr:
#### Goal 1: Security
- CSPs SHOULD use maintained versions (if they use OpenStack)
    - maybe add, that they must integrate security related bug fixes?
- otherwise CSPs MUST implement security bug fixes themself within a reasonable timeframe and provide proof of that to the OSBA (?)
    - is that reasonable?
    - it will be mandated once the [CRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Resilience_Act) is in force
- tests will only check for the presence of microversions to check the release - it will either pass or give a warning
    - in case of a warning, we can assume that either other software than openstack or older versions are used - in that case we need the documentation from the CSP for that deployment, that all known security related bugs are fixed.
- software versions can be exposed via SBOMs
    - the implementation is out of scope of *SCS-compatible*
    - could be part of *SCS-open* certification
    - freedom from known security vulns should be part of *SCS-compatible*
#### Goal 2: Interoperability
- Beyond security considerations there are also considerations of old API version diverging in behavior
    - InterOp test were meant to address this, but won't fulfill this promise in the future (are not being updated any longer)
- We can mandate the new behavior of APIs, new features, ...
    - Speed of adoption is limited by:
        - The reference implementation needs to adopt and provide it
        - Providers adopt it 
#### Conclusions:
- expecting security patches to be deployed is reasonable for *SCS-Compatible*, but may be not easily possible to test
- SBOMs are part of *SCS-Open*
- behavior changes and/or must-have new API-endpoints should be done through standards with reasonable timeframe to become "mandatory"

### Standardize requirements for network auto-allocation (@kgube)

- sample usage in the OSISM testbed, merged meanwhile
    - auto allocated network topologies not yet fully supported in the openstack.cloud Ansible collection
    - set public network to default (admin): https://github.com/osism/testbed/blob/main/environments/openstack/playbook-bootstrap-basic.yml#L55-L57
    - create default subnet pool (admin): https://github.com/osism/testbed/blob/main/environments/openstack/playbook-bootstrap-basic.yml#L71-L82
    - create auto allocated network topology (tenant): https://github.com/osism/testbed/blob/main/environments/openstack/playbook-test.yml#L103-L105
    - instance creation with auto allocated network (tenant): https://github.com/osism/testbed/blob/main/environments/openstack/playbook-test.yml#L116Rs merged for testbed
- This needs to go through the normal adoption cycle of becoming a recommendation first, being implemented as default in the reference implementation and then rolled out to the CSPs/Operators before it can be mandated and thus relied upon.
