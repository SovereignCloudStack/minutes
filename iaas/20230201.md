## Agenda

### Welcome, Jan! ‚ù§

### Sprint Review ([Board](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/4))
* Validations for deployment environments
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/28
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/225
    	- Doc pending
    	- Is relevant to highlight in ReleaseNotes
    	- Will create RelNotes label (@itrich) and add to issue
* OpenStack Image Manager for CSPs
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/168
    * See https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/pull/458
    * After above PR has been merged, we can embed the OpenStack Image Manager into our own documentation. See: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs-page/pull/13
    * Will be closed and merged today, 2023-02-01
    * https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/issues/345
    * Image Crawler is ready, but integration is pending. Check again next time. @ra-beer will reach out to @berendt to gather further information.
* Cloud-in-a-box
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/116
    * Still WIP. @ra-beer willl provide @ppuschy access to her CiaB.
    * @ra-beer is working on the documentation. Approval is needed. (AI @garloff)
    * Network connectivity (VM has no access to the gateway) is currently the worst pain point and should be addressed with highest priority. Ceph issue most likely won't be tackled the next weeks. (AI @garloff, ensure there is an issue open.)
    * Side-note: @garloff reproduced the VMDK CVE on his CiaB and was able to confirm that it has been fixed :-)
* Support Air Gap Installations #90
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/90
    	- Issue needs status update
    	- Current target is to have this for R4, @tibeer working on it
    	- @tibeer states: When will R4 be finished? I will at least need another 8 weeks of full development
    * Mid/Late March -> this might be a close one then. Let's try it. üëç
    * Discuss again in Product Board and analyze highlights that should be completed for R4.
* L3 Loadbalancing
Documentation released and ready to review: 
[SCS/PR#203](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/203/files)
Research: [SCS/Issues#251](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/251)
    * Rendered preview: https://github.com/matfechner/Docs/blob/lbaas/Design-Docs/LBaaS/lbaas.md
    * OVN provider can be configured to work like DSR
    * Building a PoC will need support from a CSP that uses ovn.
    * Start researching with CiaB, testbeds, follow-up with dedicated test- and development hardware of the OSBA (to be published as tender).
        - Update (after the meeting): ovn provider for octavia is active @ PlusServer
    * Create a new story for the real-word comparsion and testing. (@fkr, @garloff)
* Compare performance of Ceph with and without encryption
    * Blog article is WIP (@ppkuschy), support from @itrich
* OpenStack Flavor Manager for SCS Operators #236
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/183 - merged
    * Merge was done by overriding branch protection rules. Please give us a spare minute and review open pull requests!
    * Works well with the scs-compliance check tool.

### Sprint Planning
* Calling OpenStack Trademark tests (tempest/refstack) from certification checker: how?
    - @garloff to open issue against osism/issues: https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/425
