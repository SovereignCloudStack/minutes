- Responsible for the minutes (writing and transfer to github): @artifical-intelligence

### Action Items from last week's call

## Agenda

### Testing of RC1 (@fkr)

- What can we all do to improve R6?
- See <https://scs.community/2024/02/01/road-ro-r6/> for the plan
- Thanks to @maliblatt for reporting some issues!
- most currently reported issues are documentation issues, because e.g. some paths changed (fluentd, haproxy certs)
- there is one issue with upgrading mariadb when upgrading over multiple releases (health check user missing - [fix in progress](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/863))
- when using proxysql you need to use a new user (`root_shard_0` instead of `root`) to connect to the mysql database, this will also be documented
- there was also an issue with [IPv6 Deployments](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/862), fix is in progress as well.
- Sidecar by dNation will be included in the next release as well as the changes by Arvid (SIG-IAM)

### How to improve Release 6 (@fkr)

Don't ask what the release can do for you, but ask what you can do to make the release even better :)

- Contribute to [release-notes](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/pull/16)

### New deployment and day-2-ops tooling software defined storage (ceph) (@brueggemann)

- We started to implement a rook migration tool
  - will be available in a private github repo soon
- Upstream wanted an externally developed tool for migrations
- Discussion: Should the repository be located in the osism or scs github namespace?
  - Is it only focused on OSISM created ceph-ansible setups, then OSISM is the best place, if it is more generic (with reasonable additional effort), then put it to SCS namespace.
  - Tool will focus on existing OSISM clusters, analyze these (using ceph-monitor output) and then decide whether migration can be done and validate the result.
  - Decision: Put it into SCS namespace, keep focus on OSISM created ceph-ansible ceph clusters (testing, validation, ...)
- We started to think about on how to design the greenfield approach

### Open Discussion - how to solve HA for VMs?

- Topic comes up again and again
- It's not a silver bullet, but it *is* a valid solution for *some* scenarios
  - Restart VMs that were running on a host that went down
  - Opt-in (!) per VM -- cattle vs pets
  - Will not work with ephemeral local storage
  - Need to ensure that node is *really* down (fencing / stonith)
    - invest into testbed OpenStack stonith driver to make it testable?
    - requires at least 3 (virtual servers) and pacemaker/raft
- Popular due to intended VMware -> SCS migrations
- Look into masakari (but be open to other approaches)
- yaook has something: <https://gitlab.com/yaook/operator/-/blob/devel/yaook/op/nova_compute/eviction.py?ref_type=heads>
- Avoid too much complexity (corosync, pacemaker) in the stack to get this
- Requires use cases -> user stories (@frosty-geek)
- Workarounds for users like autoscaling groups?
  - Not in OpenStack (the idea of reconciliation loops is not there)
