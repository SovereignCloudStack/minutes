#### Supporting flavor aliases #228

- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/228>
- @garloff will try to bring this upstream for B release of OpenStack, C is more likely though
  - ToDo: write spec/blueprint
- @mbuechse will try to support

#### Stabilize the SSD flavor decision. #304

- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/304>

#### Stabilize v3 flavors and introduce IaaS-compatible v3 #306

- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/306>
- v3 flavors: downgrade flavors with root disks (SCS-1V-4-10) to recommended, introduce the two new SSD flavors *as mandatory*
- Make v3 IaaS standard = v2 with v3 flavors, stable at 2023-06-15 (tomorrow), until 2023-04;
  - v2 obsoleted in 2023-11
  - v1 obsoleted in 2023-10
  - Hide v2 on web page and show v1 and v3 (until 2023-10)
  - Reasoning: v2 was somewhat inconsistent by not having v2 flavors stabilized, yet v2 IaaS standard depending on it
- no one in the call objects
- Input to discussion was this:
- Flavor naming proposal by PS (ReneL) -- based on [this comment?](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/271#issuecomment-1536315678)
