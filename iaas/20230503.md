## Agenda

### Sprint Review & Planning

* Sprint name: Bratislava
* Please create Stories for the work items we’ve discussed last week.

* Ceph Quincy Epic & Stories
  * Paul on vacation, will make progress in cwk 20
* bare metal
  * Jens on vacation, progres in cwk 19
* k8s runtime for verticals
      using technology from C&H (yaook) and probably UhuruTec will create more synergy
      strategy remains the same: platform for management plane services / plugins is k8s
      different implementation: use yaook-k8s instead of k3s
      integration will likely require some work (ansible playbooks), but will pay off longer-term, also allows to distribute effort to broader community
      Goal to have this for R5 remains intact
      Review this in a meeting: @jschoone, Matthias Haag, @artificial-intelligence, @horazont, @berendt, @maliblatt, @garloff (AI set up: @berendt)

### Metric collection in the iaas reference implementation
<https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/269>

* @cah-link to report
* ceilometer issue, looks like it’s a by-design thing (launchpad discussions from 2017)
  * issue: rabbit outage will cause lack of data

* @cah-link to reopen discussions, this is a hard requirement for us
* Develop the patch, create merge request
* Try to get it merged upstream, worst case need to apply it as downstream patch
* align with @flyersa (who has tooling as well, based on ceilometer? unknown …, inner-source …) (AI @garloff, w/ @cah-link, @berendt)
* json reports for billing, use odoo for PoC for invoice creation
* cloudkitty (rating) out of scope for reference implementation
* @berendt to show @cah-link his billing approach

### Validations for deployment Environments #28
<https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/28>

* What is missing for RGW bits?
* PR missing (cwk 20)

### OpenStack Image Manager for CSPs #168
<https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/168>

* We wanted to assemble a list of upstreams that need fixing (<https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/168#issuecomment-1479210283>)
* Who can take the lead on that?
* Start with minimal list needed for internal requirements:
* Ubuntu 22.04 (testbed etc.)
* CirrOS latest
* CAPI images (currently still on Ubu 20.04)
* Next level: Use images referenced in image metadata
* Test script should also be aligned (produces spurious warnings? @berendt to open issue against it)

### IaaS ADR on providing virtio-rng entropy source #234
<https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/234>

* Changes to Linux kernel 5.17/18 required adaptation
* Please review!

### Research: Health Monitor for LB with OVN provider #268
<https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/268>

* Need to double-check whether OVN health-mon FIP issue is really resolved
* OVN would ideally support HTTP health-monitor, likely not happening short-term
* Patch to make OCCM fallback to TCP health mon by @garloff in upstream review
