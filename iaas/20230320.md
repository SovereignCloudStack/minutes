## Housekeeping & Organizational Items

- Report in the community call by: @gndrmnn
- Responsible for the minutes (writing and transfer to github): @artificial-intelligence

- Heads-Up: @fkr will be on PTO the next week - who will run the meeting?

- Sign up for the Hackathon#4! <https://input.scs.community/Hy0HqULMTGeeVIcy0vmBgA>

## Agenda

:fireworks: Release 6 is there - whoooooo

- A [blog post](https://scs.community/release/2024/03/20/release6/) got published
- [Release Notes](https://docs.scs.community/docs/releases/Release6/) exist as well and feature quite a bit of work that has been accomplished
- we have more testing and features in this release
- next release will be in september

### RHEL / CentOS compute nodes with SCS OSISM (@berendt)

- 5 Minutes
- Update on the efforts within OSISM on enabling RHEL compute nodes
- deployment of service and commons collections is possible
- next step is focussing on testing deployment of compute nodes
- there was customer demand to support RHEL/EL

### Security Groups & their default rules (@josephineSei)

- Security Groups should not be standardized, but have a guide:
  - <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/473>
  - DR: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/495>
- default Rules for Security Groups should be standardized:
  - <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/521>
  - PR: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/525>
  - new mechanism since bobcat allows admins to set new default SGs
    - discussion on default, which is now configurable (was hardcoded before Bobcat)
    - disallow ingress from the same SG? It was allowed before in the default setting.
    - AI: @artificial-intelligence test the behavior of the default security group with regards to traffic from the same SG (ingress allowed by default?)
    - @fkr: this could also be discussed with the public cloud sig
- bug in OSC encountered, successfully nudged upstream to merge the fix :)
  - <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/525#issuecomment-2007156263>

### Necessity for Floating IP Guideline (@josephineSei)

- Some strange behavior of Floating IPs:
  - <https://input.scs.community/gRSKVYboQRebi62Lx_eSMA>
  - Should there be a guideline?
  - Should we address this upstream?
  - Strangeness is that `openstack server remove floating ip this-server-does-not-exist 10.54.8.206` does not even look at the server name `this-server-does-not-exist`, but just forwards to `openstack floating ip unset --port  10.54.8.206`
  - recommendation to improve upstream docs about this possible confusion

### Barbican Plugin Check (@josephineSei, @markus-hentsch)

- For <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/509>
- Call for CSPs to tell us, whether they use Barbican and which Plugin(s) they use:
  - AI: @all @fkr: Please just add a "**+**" in here: <https://input.scs.community/Xy5SLtTjQAqn-fgliIFp3A>

### Volume Type Standard (@josephineSei)

- ready to merge
  - PR: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/351>

### Update for the Fernet situation in Keystone and Barbican (@markus-hentsch)

Problem recap: Fernet spec is limited to AES-128 cipher, not actively maintained and no modernization is expected yet it is used as a crypto backend in both Barbican and Keystone.

Keystone:

- thoughts about implications in Keystone: [comment in issues#568](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/568#issuecomment-1997112240)
  - TL;DR (just thoughts, not an audit!):
    - probably still safe to use
    - a total of 256 bit key material still necessary to craft auth tokens (due to additional HMAC portion)
      - compromising confidentiality (128 bit AES portion) seems rather harmless
    - keys are rotated, expired keys are useless
- no pressing need to deviate from the de-facto standard Fernet
  - we should be working with upstream to see if there is a medium-term improvement with JWS (or oauth)
  - Upstream docs still talk about "AES256" and "HMAC256": <https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/admin/tokens-overview.html#fernet-tokens>

Barbican with "simple crypto" default plugin:

- thoughts about implications in Barbican: [comment in issues#509](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/509#issuecomment-1997171861)
  - TL;DR (just thoughts, not an audit!):
    - situation not as easy as Keystone
    - 128 bit AES part of Fernet may already be enough for secret decryption
    - expired secrets still have value if records of old encrypted data exist (e.g. Cinder volume data)
      - AES-128 may be safe for now but not future-proof
- SCS could consider working towards setting a minimum standard for Barbican instead, but there are limitations (e.g. HSM being expensive)
  - Can we improve the "simple crypto" barbican plugin? (AES-256 and maybe chosable algos, so we can switch to quantum-safe at some point?)
- should engage with upstream
