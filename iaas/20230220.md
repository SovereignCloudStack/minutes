## Agenda

### Release preparations OSISM for 5.0.0

 - [osism/issues#448](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/448)

    * Cut of 5.0.0a until the mid of the next week
    * add of missing testbed-deploy-stable-next and 
      testbed-deploy-stable-upgrade tests in osism/testbed
    * use of Ansible core 2.14 / Ansible v7 where possible (end of next
      week, no blocker expected there)
    * use of ansible-Lint via Zuul everywhere
    * migration of check-yaml-syntax to Zuul
  
    * first check/sync of prepared 5.0.0 release notes
    * after cut of 5.0.0a: check if cloud-in-a-box is already usable
    * planning of test upgrade @ some PS test environment
  
    * documentation for Ubuntu 20.04 -> 22.04 upgrade should be prepared
      for the next release before the next release (a test should be 
      added to the testbed as well)
    * Zuul role/deployment: Jens will get in contact with Benjamin to
      work on Zuul (also required for the TSI MVP)
    * CI improvements: publish & test of osism/ci-image (should speedup 
      CI builds by 15 minutes) in the testbed

    * Replacement for hddtemp role (lmsensors) has to be completed in 
      the next 2 weeks to be able to include it in the 5.0.0 release

    * Test of Docker v23 in the Testbed and on some of our (OSISM) test
      environments (discussed that this is post R4/5.0.0 release)

    * we'll try to migrate all Ansible, Service + Kolla Container builds 
      to Zuul (then we moved the most important jobs from Github Actions 
      to Zuul)
