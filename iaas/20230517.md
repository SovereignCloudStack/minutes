## Agenda

### Housekeeping

#### SCS Summit

- NO MEETING next week!
  SCS staff on summit.

#### "Dailies" on IRC

- quick update on this by @fkr
  Little traction, stop.
  Looking for other ideas to unblock team members quickly.

### Sprint Review & Planning

Reviewing Bratislava and kicking off Copenhagen!

#### Validations for deployment Environments #28

https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/28
Mostly done, needs some cosmetic work, TBD with PR by Friday EOB.

#### OpenStack Image Manager for CSPs #168

https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/168
Crawler code has been merged, but is not currently used by our CSP partners. [PR #567](https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/pull/567) to remove code again (to improve maintainability, it's an endless catch-up game). AI @berendt, @fkr: Present openstack-image-manager in a future lightning talk. (Add to calendar: @fkr)

#### IaaS ADR on providing virtio-rng entropy source #234
https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/234
Done, hooray!
Looks like more discussion is still needed how this can best be tested, see [comment from @cah-hbaum](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/268#issuecomment-1540224051). Meeting @cah-hbaum, @mbuechse, @artificial-intelligence; AI @fkr (?): organize meeting

#### Research: Health Monitor for LB with OVN provider #268
https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/268
Issue still exists on gx-scs, if the patch is included there (OSISM-5.1.0), then the upstream bugfix is incomplete. Need to report this.

#### Stabilize the SSD flavor decision. #199
https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/199
Moving flavors with disks to "recommended" does not affect these two.
ToDo: Define local SSDs by Latency and Bandwidth requirements.
AI @fkr: Push PR with the final and stabilized version of the standard to completion / acceptance.

#### Metric collection in the iaas reference implementation #269
https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/269
Document with metrics JSON format definition still needed.
Polling issue [#320](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/320) still WIP.

#### Ceph Upgrade: Pacific -> Quincy
https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/525
Pacific going out of maintenance soon (currently estimated Jun 1, reality probably a bit later).
Need to ensure we have security fixes (if needed), thus moving to Quincy now.
Prepare CI tests, docs, then start upgrade with 5.2.0 prereleases on regio.digital, PS test/dev -> gx-scs -> prod.

#### AirGap?
not being tracked by user story; most adjacent epic: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/280

- mirroring with aptly
    - needed to build own(!) container, upstream containers unsuitable (too old, other use cases)
    - gpg(1!) key handling significant work
    - collecting trusted keys remains manual work
    - cycle time becomes problematic
    - k8s deployment working

TODO: create user stories for tracking (@tibeer)
