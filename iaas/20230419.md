### Re-visiting R4 Retro

- How to daily a proposal by @fkr
    - OFTC channel 11-12 CE(S)T: #scs

### Sprint Names

- tl;dr: We let Team Container do the hard work. AMSTERDAM it is ;)
- Long story: Good proposal by @jschoone to name our Sprints. 
  See [Sprint-Names](https://input.scs.community/2023-scs-team-container#Sprint-Names)

### Kicking off R5

#### OSISM 5.2.0 ("SCS R4.2") and further
* ceph Quincy needed by June
    * Validate that old concerns with Quincy are no longer valid/addressed/understood/  documented (@ppkuschy)
    * Migration needs automation, testing, ... (@ppkuschy)
        * CI upgrade jobs
    * Also start looking at ceph "R" release

#### -> Container team: k8s-cluster-api node images ubu20.04 -> 22.04
* [k8s-capi/#406](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/issues/406)
    * OSISM will for now build 20.04 based node images again
    * k8s team (VP-05) to take over medium-term

#### k8s on management plane (k3s?)
* For add-ons / plugins at management layer
    * Best way for keycloak (or other IdP/ID-Broker) to be deployed medium-term
    * Also makes HA easier to achieve for management services
* How to avoid blocking IAM team waiting for k8s management for HA work
    * Option 1: Use another k8s cluster for IAM HA deployment
    * Option 2: Make current ansible+docker/docker-compose approach HA
* Refinement of user stories for k8s on management plane needed: @artificial-intelligence + @berendt

#### Further automation of Bare Metal provisioning
* More integration and documentation work (e.g. redfish)
    * Close interaction with network automation needed for complete story
    * Lab hardware highly useful

#### Hardware Blueprints (@fkr)
* Really needed
* Industry would like to buy ready-to-use systems

#### Shared filesystem (RWX on k8s layer) (@matfechner)

#### Documentation is and remains a focus area
* SIG documentation / Knowledge Management engineer delivers structure, framework, ... for this
* Content creation to be organized by the technical teams (IaaS, KaaS, Ops, IAM)

#### Standards & Certification items for R5 cycle
* IaaS standards will be proposed by small group (VP-10-3 & PO & interested)
    * Discussions, priorization, decisions, ... in Team IaaS
    * Process, strategy ... in SIG Std/Cert

#### Review R5 Outcomes

- [Figma-Board-R5-Outcomes](https://www.figma.com/file/xmZ7newzY5E5NdxjHQS09S/R5---OUTCOMES?node-id=0-1&t=h4Qe0ekP4cTdgAuI-0)
- New labels for the new outcomes: (@fkr)
    * "SCS enables Operators with exc toolbox" -> rename to "SCS enables"
    * Other old labels remain, new ones to be created
- Blog post TBW (@fkr, @jschoone, @garloff)

### Sprint Planning

#### Metering (VP-13)
* Stories TBW b/w @fkr and @cah-link
#### Air-gap (@tibeer, @fkr)
#### Confidential Computing (@berendt)
* Followup with Markus (intel) when he's back
* Migrated patch testing/integration from DevStack to CiaB
* Upstream contribution next, currently these are downstream patches (which we want to avoid)
