### Extend Flavor Manager into PoC for detailed/structured flavor descriptions

- (@mbuechse)
- Premise: it would be desirable to have a detailed and structured flavor description, so that customers can have their [flavor selected automatically](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/287) (within Ansible or Terraform) according to a specification of their requirements
- Idea: build a proof of concept
    - (initial stage) augment current flavor YAML of the [OpenStack Flavor Manager](https://github.com/osism/openstack-flavor-manager) to include all manner of information (see [this list of properties](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/267#issuecomment-1610267492) for a start)
    - (first extension) find ways to incorporate the information into OpenStack
    - (second extension) come up with a mechanism for specifying customer requirements and selecting the most suitable flavor according to a given specification
- Focus on the initial stage: Who wants to weigh in or even join the effort?

### Sprint Review & Planning

#### IaaS entropy tests #268

- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/268>
- [PR could be merged](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/307), but it requires an OpenStack project with a network and a router
- these requirements could be prepared in a separate step in Zuul; waiting for Zuul to be deployed...
- working session between @mbuechse & @master-caster to do a POC of this in Zuul
- --> <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/316>

#### Research: Health Monitor for LB with OVN provider #268

- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/268>
- work is being done upstream

#### Metric collection in the iaas reference implementation #269

- issues #269, #270, #273, #277, #319
- regarding <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/320>:
    - will have another tool as kind of monitoring to use as prometheus exporter
    - @jnull already has an exporter to offer those data
        - gets data from openstack api and directly from database
        - was already planned to be published in scs context
- [Standard for metering data format in discussion](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/308)

AIs from last time:

- Move odoo_openstack_metering to scs namespace (AI: @fkr) (odoo = open source ERP software)
- @berendt & @cah-link will work on integration of metering in the testbed
    - create container image
    - create ansible role
    - documentation
    - will be done in Edmonton sprint
- AI @cah-link: please refine - <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/346>

#### Supporting flavor aliases #228

- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/228>
- Discussion in last week's meeting: try to find a principled solution ASAP

#### Stabilize the SSD flavor decision. #304

- merged
- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/304>

#### Stabilize v3 flavors and introduce IaaS-compatible v3 #306

- merged
- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/306>
- potential improvements for the future
    - vote separately on (a) stabilization of standard and (b) stabilization of certification
    - try to keep number of active versions for any certification set low (2)
    - set a stabilization date for the next version way in advance

#### Split flavor naming and mandatory flavors in two separate standards #267

- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/267>
- Work started; two open items:
    - should we list the standard flavors without referring to them by name? (because of lack of discoverability)
        - yes, this is actually desirable; solve discoverability in some other way (maybe description, maybe name, but in the meantime we can live with provider-specific solutions)
    - should the test script be split as well?
        - yes

#### Ceph Upgrade: Pacific -> Quincy #535

- <https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/525>
    - PS pending, but enabled to upgrade
        - AI: @frosty-geek to update issue
