### Storage requirements for etcd clusters

   multi-node etcd clusters need low-latency writes to storage (WAL) to work reliably
   ceph as backend storage is not working reliably without significant tweaks (slower heartbeat, unsafe! fsync filesystem tuning). Default flavor for control nodes in k8s-cluster-api-provider repo SCS-2C:4:20s not available currently on any SCS cloud.

## Summary for community team call Thu and minutes

## Discussion
   * Easiest would be to require IaaS providers to have SCS-<n>C:<m>:<o>s flavors
   * Would not support live-migration without further effort
   * where? cinder or nova ephemeral storage ?
   * Implementation via cinder tgt may be low performance, using local storage (in nova)  
   instead
   * etcd docs has detailed info on storage *latency* requirements
   * tmpfs (RAM) as fallback? even more risky than unsafe_fs
   * Requirement makes sense as well for database workloads
   * Require :20s flavors => agreement b/w plus & wave
   * need to make transparent whether or not these are live-migrated
   * real problem is if the machine crashes, as there is no way the (ephemeral!) storage can be accessed then
   * Recovery scenario needs testing:
   * Crashed control plane node should be replaced by a new node
   * The new node needs to join the k8s and the etcd cluster and be re-synced
   * Dedicated cores are recommended, but oversubscribed CPUs are not a real problem in practice
   * No agreement on requiring dedicated Cores
     -> SCS-2V:4:20s as new mandatory flavor

## Side discussion:

   * IOPS management (QoS) for local storage required?
   * Can other VMs cause write latency's for k8s control nodes etcd that can become a problem?
   => Potentially yes, (even though it's difficult for to saturate NVMe IOPS over virtio),
   needs management
   Nova provides the following flavor properties to define qos for ephemeral disk IO 
     - disk_read_bytes_sec
     - disk_read_iops_sec
     - disk_write_bytes_sec
     - disk_write_iops_sec
     - disk_total_bytes_sec
     - disk_total_iops_sec
     *[RedHat reference](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5626011)

   * Needs testing
   * Recommended values
   * Transparency via properties

## TODOs:

   * Proposal for new mandatory flavor SCS-2V:4:20s in SCS flavor => @garloff
    - Additionally SCS-4V:16:100s (separate PR)
   * Change default k8s-cluster-api-provider for control plane to SCS-2V:4:20s => @garloff
   * Crash scenario testing: Lost control plane node on a *busy* cluster => does new node (incl etcd) join successfully? => @garloff to write issue, testers? (Container team .... @garloff)
   * IOPS QoS settings testing and recommendations => IaaS team (@matfechner)
   * Make IOPS QoS settings configurable in OSISM / via OSISM tooling (@matfechner w/ @fkr)
   * Make local volumes available to nova in OSISM (@matfechner)
   * Flavor spec with properties for transparency (live migration, IOPS)
     needed => @garloff
