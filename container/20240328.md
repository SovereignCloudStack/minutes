### cluster-stacks Release automation (@mxmxchere)
A first idea for automatically creating GitHub Releases from the repo state can be found here: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/51/files

### cluster-stacks k8s-version from clusterspec (@mxmxchere)
Currently all cluster-classes hardcode the k8s-version of the cluster via the image. It should be possible (in certain borders) A.) for the User to alter the k8s-version themselves B.) to see which version the cluster running actually has.

Proposal can be found here: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/20

### discussion about CVE scanning tools for k8s clusters (@martinmo)
Background: As part of conformance testing, we must check for unpatched CVEs in a running K8s cluster. We currently use a simple, custom approach (it just uses the version reported by connecting to the kube-apiserver, see https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/526).

Ideally we use a standard solution, I did some research about that and the only nice tool that satisfies the requirements seems to be `trivy` (it is Apache-2.0, it can check the versions of the components of a cluster, and not just the containers running in the cluster).

I wanted to discuss if Team Container knows some other solutions that are worth investigating.
