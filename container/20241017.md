### Standards
#### k8s networking/CNI requirements (@kgube)

Issue: [Standardize k8s networking policies (CNI) #769](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/769)
* Last week, we talked about recommending the Gateway API
    * should we add a requirement for Ingress while Gateway is recommended?
    * both might be [out of scope for the standard](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L37)
    * Standard Draft for KaaS LB: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/169
* Does it make sense to mandate the basic Service API?
    * do we have any existing requirements regarding load balancing? 
- Default Ingress in CSPs
    - Azure doesn't offer it by default
- Differentiate Cluster vs KaaS compliance
- Users should be able to enable ingress-controller while creating Cluster
    - could be an on/off switch in cluster-stacks
        - ingress-controller will be sub chart in cluster-addon
        or
        - independent routine which runs after creating the cluster

#### Network Policies
- CNI must support Network Policies
- Their exists some best/good practice NetPols, which must be named in the Standard
    - e.g. deny other Namespace or deny access to metadata service

#### HostID and Server Groups
- Current CAPO implementations are not able to do so
    - workaround will be to run a Kubernetes Job with `openstackclient` to fulfill the standard
