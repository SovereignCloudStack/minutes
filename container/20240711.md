#### Cluster Stacks
- ClusterStacks `openstack-scs` as Default
    - with upgraded v1->v2 migration path
    
Features that are currently missing (but worked in k8s-cluster-api-provider) 
  - Security Groups (worked before in k8s-cluster-api-provider, by using openstack-cli), now there is upstream support (CAPO) for it
  - Server Groups (worked in v1 using openstack-cli, upstream work is happening (slowly) (CAPO)
  - Host ID (support currently missing, needs to be implemented in OCCM)

---
- List of the features (variables, summary could be something to include into the Release notes)
    - `restrict_kubeapi` needs to be finished, depends on loadbalancer
- openstack-csp-helper
- Docs up-to-date, not only regarding the content but also the publication under [docs.scs](https://docs.scs.community)
#### Cluster Stack Operator
- OCI registry support as alternative to GitHub releases
    - PR open for CSO
    - new flag for csctl
- Multi-Stage-Addons
    - few minor polishes left, but mostly done
#### Providers
- Openstack (primary, mostly used clusterstack)
- Kamaji (merged and deployed in the moin-cluster, testing appreciated, planned to be the default in the cluster-gen UI)
- MetalÂ³ (in review, successful tests have been carried out using sushy)
- KubeVirt (in review, successful tests)

If we have multiple cluster-stacks with equal importance we should think a about a mechanism that ensures same naming of clsuter-variables among them (in case they are applicable to all)
#### Others
- KaaS GUI (Cluster Gen) naming debatable, but Malte likes it, scope of the GUI is to generate Cluster-objects only, no apply, no status feedback
    - cool names: https://acronymify.com/search?q=Cluster+YAML+Generator
- yawol Support
- csctl-provider-openstack (provider-openstack is new since R6)
- moin-cluster-config (is a good starting point in case you have to create a cluster-stacks setup, but debatabe whether we want to communicate is as such, or only use it for our internal purposes)

### Standardize a simple default storageclass (@martinmo)
- Issue [#652](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/652)
- Existing standard [scs-0211-v1](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0211-v1-kaas-default-storage-class/) with (too?) strict requirements -> would be replaced
- Objections to that idea?
- if not, @martinmo will bring this to SIG Standardization for further processing
    - Jan already received feedback that users are missing a default storageclass (feedback from opendesk people)
    - enforcing the existence of a default storage class was mostly just forgotten -> no problem to do that now
    - performance/persistence aspects might be beneficial to be tied to a default-class (could confuse usesrs to be named persistens-storage but can disappear when scheduling a new node)
    - forcing too strict standards could make k8s edge deployments non compliant

### Status Update Cluster-gen
* UI is being reworked to generate forms dynamically, depending on the cluster-variables, currently reads from file
* middleware capi-jsgen generates Clusterschemas (Description of the strucuture of a Cluster object in json), code can be found here: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/capi-jsgen
* cluster-gen reads those schemas to generate the cluster form
