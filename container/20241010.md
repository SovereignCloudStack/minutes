### Create standard on k8s CNI requirements (@kgube)

Issue (Standard): [Standardize k8s networking policies (CNI) #769](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/769)
Issue (ADR, closed as duplicate by @mbuechse): [Write ADR for Container Networking/CNI #324](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/324)
* Are they actually duplicates?
* How to proceed with the topic?
* There are a few suggestions in [standards#324](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/324#issuecomment-1695603812):
    * Basic CNI plugin capabilities
    * Host based firewall (see also Network Policy)
        * (This seems to be a Cilium-exclusive feature)
    * Gateway API features HTTPRoute and TLSRoute
        * ([Calico seems to not implement the Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/))
    * [Network Policy]( https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#behavior-of-to-and-from-selectors)

Discussion
* Avoid forcing Cilium through standards (Isovalent has been bought by Cisco)
* Basic CNI is always there
* Standardize Network Policies as mandatory for now
* Gateway: Make it a recommendation for now (for KaaS-v1 in Nov'24)

### Change timeframe for providing new patch releases (@mbuechse)

- PR [standards#770](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/770)
- Change from 1 week to 2 weeks to give providers sufficient time for testing
- please approve...
- no different opinions

### Value of KaaS standards w.r.t. limiting K8s version sprawl (@berendt)
- Discussion: Should operators force customer clusters to be upgraded?
    - Depends on the precise split of responsibilities b/w provider and customer
        - Forcing only works if it's a fully managed service -> recommendation
- Clusters that no longer receive k8s patches are not SCS-compliant
- Differentiate between KaaS-conformity and Cluster-conformity
    - KaaS-compliant platforms should produce SCS-compliant clusters by default (but don't necessarily prevent customers from chosing parameters that result in non-compliant clusters)
    - Maybe enforce warnings and notifications?
- AI @garloff: Survey CSPs:
    - How do they handle upgrades? Enforcing?
    - Same for node images ...
