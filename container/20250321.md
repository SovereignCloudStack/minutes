    - Changing in the repos may break docusaurus builds, so we need to fix up after the fact
        - Can push to staging branch of docs to test

### Introduce ORC image
- adding object to cluster-class
    - ORC image works acc to @jschoone and @matofeder
- CSO needs more permissions to create that object
    - already in PR [#185](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/185)
        - Added RBAC rules to allow CSO to manage images via ORC
        - Replacement for CSPO (we lose validation, but there was not much to speak of ...)
        - PR could be moved from CS to CSO. Should. (AI @jschoone)
- Discussion: Interaction with sharing cluster classes
    - Images in OpenStack are project-specific
        - Could be shared (`openstack image add project`)
        - Or we use a central project ... with public/community images
