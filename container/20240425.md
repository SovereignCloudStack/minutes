### Cluster Stacks
#### Improvements
- Bunch of issues in the [Cluster Stacks repo](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/issues)
    - goal is to have *one* Cluster Stack at the end on CAPO v0.10.0 with default settings which makes it possible to run on SCS IaaS ootb
        - Currently two stacks, a generic one and the one without octavia
    - yawol should be integrated via switch, we thought about it, even it bloats the Cluster Stack this is acceptable for this case
        - Avoid a separate stack "just" for this "little" difference
        - Need to ensure that all relevant settings ("big switches") combinations are tested
        - Currently no test scenarios -> goal: test "big switches"
            - Will be created, need to have a collection of settings (e.g., 1 control plane nodes vs 3)
    - Work in progress 
      - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/issues/80 - about variables and specifics of cluster stacks -> discussion ongoing with @chess-knight
      - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/issues/56
      - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/53 - Add zuul e2e for openstack cluster-stacks @michal-gubricky


#### CAPI Providers 
- Work on MetalÂ³ and KubeVirt has been started
    - both can use the exact same images as we use for CAPO
    - @chess-knight started working on this, fixed issues upstream
- Kamaji is about to [add a `KamajiControlPlaneTemplate`](https://github.com/clastix/cluster-api-control-plane-provider-kamaji/discussions/90) which is required to be used in a ClusterClass
    - then we add that quite easy
    - which will also be a good addition to the [Moin cluster](https://input.scs.community/#Moin-Cluster) since users can spin up clusters without wasting resources
    - there was contact with Dario from upstream, they support this

#### Cluster Stack Operator
- Work on [Multi-Stage-Cluster-Addons](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-operator/pull/64) can be continued
    - we'll get more Details an see a Demo in the call after next, probably May 16 with a view to the holidays
    - we need to understand what it is and why it's needed ...
        - Interactions with cluster life-cycle operations?

#### csctl
- csctl-plugin-openstack successfully tested to build images and upload them to an S3 bucket (gx-scs swift)
    - PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/csctl-plugin-openstack/pull/4
    - invitation to others to test this PR before it gets merged!

### Moin Cluster
- Shared Cluster currently available for every member of the SCS GitHub org (via OIDC)
    - Keycloak can be added as soon as there is one available for the project
- @mxmxchere did a live demo (using kubeconfig provided below)
  - usually, you can't access anything unless you are in the admin group (is on the TODO list)
- Dex currently runs externally in WaveStack
    - Requires plugin: https://github.com/int128/kubelogin
- It is planned to have GitOps for this cluster (see below)
- Idea: Jan should do a lightning talk

#### Cluster configuration
- Will be handled with usual GitOps approach in [this repo](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/moin-cluster-config)
- The "full" current config should be present there, then we can rebuild the whole cluster because it is currently based on a local built Cluster Stack with rudimentary oidc support
    - Every needs can then be requested in the repo
    - initial setup https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/moin-cluster-config/issues/3 planned after cluster-stacks consolidation

##### **kubeconfig**
```
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: https://moin.k8s.scs.community
  name: moin-cluster
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: moin-cluster
    namespace: default
    user: moin-cluster-user
  name: moin-cluster-user@moin-cluster
current-context: moin-cluster-user@moin-cluster
kind: Config
users:
- name: moin-cluster-user
  user:
    exec:
      apiVersion: client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1
      args:
      - oidc-login
      - get-token
      - --oidc-issuer-url=https://dex.k8s.scs.community
      - --oidc-client-id=kubectl
      - --oidc-extra-scope=groups,profile
      command: kubectl
```

### Hacking-Sessions
- The former fridays Hacking Session should be revived
    - probably beginning on May 10 every Friday 11:35 - 12:55, see [calendar PR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/calendar/pull/277)
    - Perhaps a spontaneous session on May 3
    - should be in a Hands-on format focussing on KaaS and be about the Cluster Stack components and how to use them
    - Participants should document their learnings in a HedgeDoc, if possible

### Bonus topic from @mxmxchere :-)
- Going back the question how many cluster stacks we want
    - 4 folders currently (1_27, 1_28, 1_29, 1_27_wooctavia)
    - challenge is to keep them all consistent
        - overhead that seems unnecessary
        - we have duplication -> should be avoided
    - a lot of duplication caused by having one cluster class per k8s minor version
    - yawoll switch will eliminate one class, leaves 3 (plus upcoming for 1_30 ...)
    - proposed solution: keep k8s version independent things in a `common` directory and use symlinks
    - proposed variation of the `common` approach (Kurt): defaults and overrides
