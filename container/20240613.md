## :notebook: Agenda

### KaaS V1 daily E2E tests are still failing - from Ops meeting (@chess-knight, @scoopex)

- fix it?
    - try new gx-scs "s" flavors? Yes
    - Use SCS-2V-4-20s for all control-plane (i.e. etcd) nodes
        - Docs: https://docs.plusserver.com/en/compute/pluscloudopen/reference/local-storage/
        - We need to set the metadata key to ensure VMs get restarted after a hypervisor reboot
            - For regular maintenance, opt-in is surprising ... would expect opt-out
            - This is different from crashing hosts
            - Alternative is to watch the metadata notification and migrate yourself (this is what PSKE does)
            - Input very much appreciated by PS
- remove it?
    - wait for KaaS V2 tests?
    - KaaS v1 will be maintained until R7, which includes the e2e tests

### Kamaji OpenStack Cluster Stack (@chess-knight)

- PR is ready https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/104
    - Some manual steps needed due to upstream changes available in the next release(v0.10.0)
        - [cluster-api-control-plane-provider-kamaji#107](https://github.com/clastix/cluster-api-control-plane-provider-kamaji/pull/107)
        - [cluster-api-control-plane-provider-kamaji#109](https://github.com/clastix/cluster-api-control-plane-provider-kamaji/pull/109)
- Kamaji control plane runs on workers of management cluster
    - Anti-affinity to be determined
    - Watch out: gx-scs has a limited set of hypervisors, so we need to be careful with hard anti-affinity
        - Talk to PS in that case


### Evaluated use of general purpose Image / compared to CAPI (@mxmxchere)
https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/issues/102
-> seems to be quite easy
- Slowdown does not appear to be significant (exact measurements were not done -- kubelet, kubeadm, cri-o runtime installation is not that heavy ...)
- Advantage is that this lowers the requirements on the infra provider (does not need to provide the ubuntu-capi- images which are recommended only - so we no longer would have to register the images per project in case the IaaS provider does not deliver them)
- Would move us further away from having immutable machines
- PSKE moved from ubuntu/debian to flatcar images
    - politics for using flatcar might be more problematic (MSFT, lock-in?), to be evaluated
    - Alpine probably unsuitable b/c lack of systemd and glibc
    - Reason for flatcar in PSKE: Too many moving parts in Ubuntu/Debian


### State of the moin-cluster (@mxmxchere)
preliminary diagnosis:
- broken loadbalancer-service (OpenStack-wise)
    - LB service was fixed by PS
        - OSISM bug #9
    - ingress needed redeployment to make LB work again
- unhappy etcd (likely storage + leader elections)
    - move to new flavors (SCS-2V-4-20s)

### Docs how to access the moin cluster to be published
