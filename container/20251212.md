## :notebook: Agenda
### scs2 with k8s-1.33.6 (@garloff)
- @schneidarno approved ([PR#240](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/240)), thanks
- But: csctl fails to publish `Error: failed to validate with latest release hash: no change in the cluster stack`
- AI @garloff to open against csctl

### scs2 with k8s-1.34 (@garloff)
- Anyone already looked into it?
- No, @arnoschneidunia can push to registry with robot account for testing

### scs2 moving to capi `cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta2` (@garloff)
- Anyone already looked into it?
- Structure has changed, needs investigation

### SCS-compatible KaaS v1 (@garloff)
- How to get a handle on the [standards/#928](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/982) discussion?
	- e2e tests failing w/ cilium
		- Linux Node Port (always) `HostPort validates that there is no conflict between pods with same hostPort but different hostIP and protocol`
			- No-brainer ...
		- SCTP (kubeproxy less mode)
			- How to best test?
	- Need domain knowledge and reading through #928 and linked cilium and sctp discussions
	- Can exclude tests, but we should *not* create a list of known-good CNIs (that's against the spirit of our standardization)
	
### Chosing service LoadBalancer (@schneidarno)
- Unlike the LB in front of the kubeAPI, the one created for services (such as with ingress) by OCCM defaults to the cloud's defaults (amphorae)
- No clusterClass variable currently to control it
- Not trivial due to the way OCCM helm chart generates `cloud.conf`
- AI @garloff: Create issue to build good solution: [Issue#241](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/issues/241)
- Hack: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/scs-training-kaas-scripts/blob/main/_11-fixup-ovn-lb.sh

### Scheduling container calls 2026
- AI @garloff: Send proposal to scs-tech, follow up with @matofeder, @jschoone, @arnoschneidunia
- Proposal would be biweekly, starting Jan 9, 9:05 CET
