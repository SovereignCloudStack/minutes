## :notebook: Agenda
### Standards
* one more approval on each of them would be nice
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/376 (waiting on @artificial-intelligence)
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/361 (waiting on @jschoone)
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/392 (will push later today on 25-01-2024)

### Csmctl and OpenStack
* We can integrate OpenStack support for csmctl, so that cluster stack release assets can be created with the CLI tool. This requires a complete process of how node images are supposed to be built.
    * <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/csmctl>
    * create assets based on the cluster stack which can be directly used with the cluster stack operator
    * currently a lot of manual work
    * OpenStack support needed if we want to build node images
        * Alternative is to use plain generic images or the ones from OSISM (which is what KaaS v1 uses) and allow kubeadm to do all the installation/configuration upon boot
        * Tailor-made images would allow for immutable images (and faster creation of clusters)
            * Decision: Keep this as goal ...
            * ... but not urgent, as the current solution without tailor-made images works well
* Demo session wanted
* Use streamcast format to communicate this to a wider public
* Naming: The `m` in `csmctl` is from manager (which was planned but is no longer needed) -> renaming it to `csctl` would be good, but we need to ensure the naming conflict with existing `csctl` tools (yes: tool*s*) is not likely to affect our users.

### CSPO
* [Release v0.1.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-provider-openstack/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.1)
* Unit/integration tests - WIP - with 2 open PRs already: [#53](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-provider-openstack/pull/53), [#54](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-provider-openstack/pull/54)

### SCS Container layer monitoring
* SIG Monitoring 
    * SCS services (also container team related) are observed via SCS Observer - dashboards available at https://monitoring.scs.community
        * still WIP, the stable state will be annouced soon (target: early next week)
    * alerting will be done first to a general Matrix channel
    * Thanos usage appreciated, as it is a robust solution for long-term persisting metrics data and allowing for multi-tenant usage.
    * Dashboard creation uses some automation (yaml generation) -> demo session offered (tentative: next Thu Container Team call)
    * See https://github.com/sovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability and in particular [PR #33](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/pull/33)

### RELENG R6 SCS KaaS Reference Implementation
* what should be released as a SCS KaaS in R6?
    * Cluster Stacks with OpenStack/SCS IaaS (greenfield)
    * Migration KaaS v1 -> v2 complete enough (in terms of understanding, tooling, documentation) so we can stop maintaining v1?
        * Taking over cluster classes of running looks feasible
        * Cluster-Stacks currently lacks the ability to create v1 style clusters
* release candidate in early Feb?
    * see CSPO and csmctl 

### Status Update clusterstack openstack implementation/migration
* cluster-class transferred from k8s-cluster-api-provider to cluster-class-helmchart in cluster-stacks
* rewriting templating mechanism from helm to cluster-class's patch-mechanism (transferred variables, patches are next https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/15)
