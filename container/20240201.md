### SCS Container layer monitoring demo (@chess-knight/@matofeder)
* the current state of https://monitoring.scs.community (briefly)
    * https://github.com/dNationCloud/kubernetes-monitoring
    * all Grafana charts are produced by Helm and jsonnet to create JSON files with the correct values/variables
    * High-availability (/scaling) of the observer cluster is currently implicit through the k8s-based setup. No secondary stand-by clusters are planned
* demo of k8s monitoring (basic setup)
    * Thanos is pulled in as bitnami chart via Helm dependency: https://github.com/dNationCloud/kubernetes-monitoring-stack/blob/main/chart/Chart.yaml#L34

### KaaS-Hackathon Bratislava
- Preliminary agenda: https://input.scs.community/yrVXQ4-tRlODXI4Ic8FfQg

### Standards
* one more approval on each of them would be nice
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/376 (waiting on @artificial-intelligence)
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/361 ~~(waiting on @jschoone)~~ (merged)
    * @cah-hbaum not available today, so can't answer questions about that

### Clusterclass-template port state report
- Templating with helm 100% parity with k8s-cluster-api-provider (to the best of my knowledge)
- Templating / patching with cluster-api cluster-class approach is imposing some challenges https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/issues/11
- how much effort should we put into it? Should we call it finished (all templating is possible with helm) and start with a fresh/clean cluster-class? https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/issues/16
- --> moved to next meeting
