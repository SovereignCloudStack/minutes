## :notebook: Agenda

### Container meeting schedule (@matofeder)
- Biweekly, even weeks, Fri 9:05 CET
- Survivor bias: Are there people that would like to attend but can not make this slot? (AI: @jschoone to ask via matrix)
- Use matrix and github to coordinate work in between meets

### State of the registry (@garloff, @matofeder)
- registry.scs.community has been migrated to the scs2 (from scs1)
- it works expect OIDC auth
    - users can pull from registry, but can not login to it via OIDC and then they are blocked from using UI and pushing new versions of OCI artifacts
- registry used for
    - cluster stack testing
    - prometheus openstack exporter image
    - zuul-mqtt-matrix-bridge image

-> IAM/Ops/Sec meeting?

### Go through open issues/PRs (@jschoone)
- [PR cluster-stackes/#197](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/197): @matofeder, @jschoone
    - Should apply to all cluster stack versions
    - [Generator](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/blob/main/hack/generate_version.py) from @DEiselt consumes [versions.yaml](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/blob/main/providers/openstack/scs/versions.yaml)
- Only one issue categorized as bug: [issue cluster-stacks/#146](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/issues/146)
    - [PR cluster-stacks/#177](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/177)
    - Fails in zuul
    - zuul may need attention to use a nodepool on SCS2 (instead of the decomissioned SCS1): AI @garloff

### Publish new Cluster Stack versions (@jschoone)
- Discussion aroound [PR #199](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/199)
- In [cluster stacks repo](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/blob/main/hack/generate_version.py): `hack/generate_version.py --build`
- Bad practice: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/tree/main/providers/openstack/scs/cluster-addon/charts contains downloaded (helm fetched) artifacts
    - unnecessary, b/c https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/blob/main/providers/openstack/scs/cluster-addon/Chart.lock already has the versions locked
    - CSO expects it, though (based on a look at the source code), `--dependency-update` parameter needed to make helm succeed, but not used by CSO
    - Duplicated information is bad, could get out of sync and break, should get rid of tarballs
        - Should be fixed: [Issue CSO/#277](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-operator/issues/277)
- yawol and kubevip support can be removed from openstack cluster stacks due to lacking usage
    - PR: AI @jschoone
    - C&H's yaook is implementing octavia APIs
        - Still WIP

### How ORC can help us (@jschoone)
- Next meeting
- Maybe it will make CSPO obsolete
    - Supports checksums
- capo server group management via ORC as well?
- Integration/Deployment of ORC may evolve ...
