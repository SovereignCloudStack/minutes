## :notebook: Agenda
### Last week for VP06a (@jschoone)
### How to put Network Policies in every Namespace (@jschoone)
Challenge: metadata service exposes information
- OpenStack format: `curl http://169.254.169.254/openstack/latest/; echo`, AWS format: `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/; echo`
- Deny connection baked into the node image
    - not before bootstrapping
- Distribute Kyverno ClusterPolicy
    - can users delete them afterwards?
        - Probably no need to prevent that, because it has not that sensible data
            - password from `meta_data.json` is unused by our node images and kubeadm (we inject ssh keys, like everyone does on Linux)
            - token in `user_data` is used to join the cluster which belongs to the user anyways
            - Double check that we don't leak data that allows more than the user shooting himself
- `AdminNetworkPolicy` (currently only in new Kubernetes versions)
- GlobalNetworkPolicy via native CNI implementation
    - Calico and Cilium have something

### NetworkPolicy standardization
- We want to have CNIs that can separate network traffic (e.g. between namespaces)
- Common k8s network policies deliver that
- We thus should require them for compliant clusters in *SCS-compatible KaaS v1*
- ToDo:
    - Reference precise upstream Network Policy spec (with `AdminNetworkPolicy` if possible)
    - Testcase
    - Ensure reference implementation passes
- Maybe the metadata service access protection will not make it into v1 ... then we should at least have a draft
