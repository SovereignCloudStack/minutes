## :telephone: Community call and minutes transfer

* Who is reporting in the community call? : @jschoone
* Responsible for the minutes (writing and transfer to github): @mxmxchere
 
## :notebook: Agenda
### Cluster-Gen UI (@paulphys, @DEiselt)
- Proof of concept Web UI for creating cluster objects based on Cluster Stacks
- Edit and download ```clusterstack.yaml``` and ```cluster.yaml``` with live editor
- [Repo](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-gen) and [live demo](https://cluster-gen.moin.k8s.scs.community)
- Built with Next.js and TypeScript, entirely client-side rendered, deployment with docker 
- Feedback/critique needed
### Moin-Cluster (@mxmxchere)
 - backups enabled (k8s-resources, no Volume snapshots), backup-target: regio-s3
 - now running with controlplane nodes with "s" flavor
  -> next step, component update automation, monitoring, deploy cluster-gen via flux
### Cluster Stack Folder Structure (@jschoone)
- to avoid repetition we can now generate the `SCS` Cluster Stack from one single source for various versions
### KaaS V1 daily E2E tests fixed (@chess-knight)
- PR [#742](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/742) resolves it
- ![latest](https://zuul.scs.community/api/tenant/SCS/badge?project=SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider&pipeline=periodic-daily&branch=main)
### KaaS monitoring - from Ops meeting (@chess-knight)
- Request by Malte/B1 to integrate moin.k8s.scs.community cluster into our already deployed monitoring stack: https://monitoring.scs.community
    - Estimate: 1 person day, delegate to Roman/Michal
### KaaS Node Distribution Standard stabilization (@martinmo/@cah-hbaum)
- Issue [#639](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/639)
- Goal: stabilize the standard
- Open questions, such as:
    - How is node distribution handled on installations with shared-control planes (Kamaji, Gardener, etc)?
        * clean up with the term "shared controlplane". In all scenarios that we are dealing with her the new feature is to share control plane *nodes* not th controlplanes themselves
        * Standard case kamaji: dedicated controlplane components with shared etcd, everything hosted in k8s (no dedicated nodes), etcd is deployed with antiaffinity (kube-scheduler tries to spread across nodes). Relation of the nodes to each other is unknown to k8s
        * Gardener: 
            * Non-HA: single-replica controlplane (dedicated, but hosted in shared seed-cluster).
            *  HA: (multiple replicas, hosted in seed-cluster but with awareness to tolerate zone failure or node failure) https://gardener.cloud/docs/guides/high-availability/control-plane/#node-failure-tolerance
    - Can this be tested / what privileges are needed to test this?
        - scs-cluster-stack solution: moin-cluster
        - Gardener: either PSKE (access via @joshmue) or regio (access via @mxmxchere)
- related to next agenda point
### KaaS conformance tests with other providers/implementations (@martinmo)
- Issue [#649](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/649)
- Currently we test reference impl in Zuul E2E tests
- We want to test other implementations as well, especially Gardener
- Can someone provide us with access?
        - scs-cluster-stack solution: moin-cluster (oidc + GitHub team)
        - Gardener: either PSKE (access via @joshmue) or regio (access via @mxmxchere)
        - PSKE docs: https://docs.plusserver.com/en/container/managed-kubernetes/documentation/clusterinteraction/cluster-provisioning/
### Cluster Class for KubeVirt (@michal-gubricky)
 - [PR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/106) is ready for review
 - CSI driver can be enabled via cluster variable `csi_driver`
 - Loadbalancing is done by using `cloud-provider-kubevirt`
### (if time left) Overview issue for KaaS layer standardization (@martinmo)
- FYI: New epic issue [#615](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/615) provides a (hopyfully) better overview
