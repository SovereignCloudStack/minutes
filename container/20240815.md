## :notebook: Agenda
### Cluster Stacks on Hetzner Baremetal
- We'll see a demo in this call next week (2024-08-22)
- Commercial offering that dNation is building
    - Source code in CS repositories

### Readiness of KaaS for R7
- Critical things are all in good shape
- Support for OCI instead of github (CSO+CSPO)
- Upgrade from KaaSv1 to v2 testing: Done for R5->R6, may need some retesting (Nils, AI @jschoone to reach out)
- Documentation needs some more work
    - especially needs exposure to docs.scs.community, so it can be found
- Upstream capo+occm work
    - capo 0.10 includes custom security group management
    - access host-ID (to test for anti-affinity rule compliance): WIP, will likely happen after R7 [#2579](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/issues/2579)
    - Server Group feature [#1912](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-openstack/pull/1912) (same status: WIP, likely after R7)
- Tests were done with the following version configuration in different OpenStack environments:
    ```
    CSO_VERSION=v0.1.0-alpha.6  # latest
    CSPO_VERSION=v0.1.0-alpha.4  # latest
    CSP_HELPER_URL="../v0.6.0/openstack-csp-helper.tgz"       # latest
    CS_K8S_VERSION=1.29
    CS_VERSION=v2
    CS_K8S_PATCH_VERSION=3
    ```
    - Trouble on C&H env b/c of missing LBaaSv2
         - Other environments had issues with Load Balancers that needed to be resolved on the OpenStack layer
    - Expiring App Creds on running Mgmt Cluster:
        - Exchanging the secrets with a working app cred got the mgmt cluster back into a good state

### EOF event contribution (20mins)
- Intro by @jschoone
- KCD talk from Munich @janiskemper
