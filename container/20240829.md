## :notebook: Agenda
### :information_source: Announcement (@jschoone)
- No Container Call next week due to [EOF](https://events.scs.community/eof/)
 
### KaaS Standards discussions (@jschoone)
- [Standards#615](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/615)
- AI @jschoone: Move to SIG Standardization
- Standard for Network Policies
    - since there are different CNIs it can't be difficult to implement
    - AI: @jschoone ask DP/VP04 to research about NetPols

### Improvement of KaaS Docs (@DEiselt, @jschoone)
- https://docs.scs.community/docs/category/components-1
- Cluster Stacks has cards for its relevant components
- restructured docs on source repos to be compliant
- partly improvement of content
- much more to see now, but still WIP (operational blindness made it hard the last days :see_no_evil:)
- feel free to add issues/PRs for stuff you miss/want to have improved

### OCI-Client for CSPO (@jschoone, done by @chess-knight but public holiday in SK)
- [CSPO#198](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-provider-openstack/pull/198)
- In review

### New Cluster Stack SCS Releases (@jschoone)
- Cluster Stacks `SCS` now available with updated Kubernetes, CCM and Cinder-CSI versions
- Are available via [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/releases) as Pre-release, but will be moved to registry.scs.community as soon as the OCI clients are merged
- Also [Quickstart](https://docs.scs.community/docs/container/components/cluster-stacks/components/cluster-stacks/providers/openstack/quickstart) is now build on those instead of `alpha`.
- ToDo (@jschoone): Remove format validator for external_id and make default empty
- ToDo (@garloff): Update flavor name defaults to reference only SCS mandatory flavors


### Release Notes R7 (@jschoone)
- [release-notes#27](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/pull/27)

### Taxonomy of Failsafe Levels (@josephineSei)

- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/579
- @martinmo and I restructured this DR
- we would like to see people check for sanity
- KaaS parts are still partly missing
    - I come from IaaS and cannot do this.
    - need help from a Volunteer to add Container specific information
        - Volunteer: @jschoone, @DEiselt
