## Agenda
* Workplan for R4 (see slides) https://scs.sovereignit.de/nextcloud/apps/files/?dir=/Sovereign%20Cloud%20Stack/Technology/ContainerStandardization-2022&fileid=79772
  * What will be a SCS standard, what will not be part of SCS standards?
  * Write large epic (with depending user stories) including all desired cluster features
  * Conformance tests should reliably attest proper function of all feature's
 
 * Create standard -> start with simple cluster, we have already 
categorized settings from R2 SCS cluster-api and built a proposal for a 
minimal cluster => try to implement as PoC for Gardener, CAPI and 
Gridscale
  (https://github.com/23technologies/scs-cluster-crd)
 
 * Reminder: 15:05 today: Discsussion on requirements to IaaS for 
flavors that reliably support multi-node etcd clusters (storage latency 
requirements et. al.)
