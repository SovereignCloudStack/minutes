### Finalization of `scs2` cluster stacks
#### Features
- We have most what was mentioned in [PR #232](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/232)
- `additionalBlockDevice` is in, no?
  * YES :white_check_mark:
- We support diskful flavors by defaulting to them (but should use `SCS-2V-4-20s` as default at least for control plane, no?)
  * Do it (@jschoone) :white_check_mark: 
- `--update-dependencies` status https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-operator/pull/296
  * Works
  	* Needs to be mentioned in release notes (`scs2` requires CSO release - align with syself)
  * CI checks failing for updates in pipeline
  	* e.g. [PR #296](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-operator/pull/296)
  	* Want to include those if not too tedious, ask syself for a look / support
- I have seen `restrictKubeApi` in `apiServerLoadBalancerOctaviaAmphoraAllowedCIDRs`
	* Untested (AI test: @garloff)
- Controlling `serviceLoadBalancer` via tweaking `cloud.conf` construction (currently generated from helm chart in OCCM)
	* Unclear whether we can deliver this after the release
	* `cloud.conf` generation needed
- Gateway CRD deployment missing
	* Make this opt-in? (AI @jschoone)
#### Testing
- CNCF e2e tests (without the cilium exception) passing?
	* ToDo: @jschoone and @garloff
#### Documentation / Release Notes
- ToDo: @garloff, @jschoone to proofread
#### Migration tool/docu `scs` -> `scs2` cluster class
- ToDo: Will deliver this after R9
