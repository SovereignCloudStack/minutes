### Izmir mid-sprint review
[Taskboard](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/7?filterQuery=label%3A%22container%22+iteration%3A%40current&layout=table&groupedBy%5BcolumnId%5D=Status&sortedBy%5Bdirection%5D=desc&sortedBy%5BcolumnId%5D=Status)
* [#311](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/311) -> Doing, mostly done actually, PR [#503](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/503) (one last bug left ...)
* [#480](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/480) -> capo consuming FIPs in a loop
    * PR [#504](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/504): Random names may avoid naming conflict (if no cluster name is set use a testcluster-$RANDOM name instead of current default testcluster)
        * Move forward (maybe fewer random chars?)
    * An additional option may be to fix [#495](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/issues/495) and have all resources prefixed with unique mgmt-host PREFIX
        * Enhancement: Detect prefix conflict and create good error message [#506](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/issues/506) - explicitly disallow reusing the prefix
    * Also changing capo to reference the LB by UUID might help (but may be quite some upstream work to get done)


### R5 on 2023-09-20 highlights (container view)
#### Brainstorming (PB)
* e2e testing (with zuul) for k8s stuff
    * Still WIP -> feature is at risk for R5, but keep trying
    * Not user-centric (but developer-centric), so won't be in top-level highlights
* cilium as default
    * Done, release notes need to be written (why is this good?)
* WIP: gateway API
    * Documentation/Release Notes -> @mxmxchere
* k8s-capi works with private CA now
    * Done
* registry - up2date and documented, HA (partial), using as cache (dockerhub, â€¦), also used outside of SCS (dNation)
    * Already mentioned, message could also include mentioning registry.scs.community and dNation's deployment -> @chess-knight
* TechPreview: clusterstacks & ClSt Operator
    * Documents are being created (@batistein)
#### Finishing R5:
* List of highlights complete? What's missing?
    * Outside Containers: diskless flavors
* Are all highlights in a presentable state? Completion status? Automated testing? Documentation? Release Notes?
* Also document most prominent highlights inherited from upstream (e.g. k8s, cilium, capi+capo, ...)
