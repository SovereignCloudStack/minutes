### Planning `scs2` cluster stack series (for SCS R9 in mid Sept) - recap
* Improvements for new SCS2 [PR #232](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/232)
	* ToDo: Review and test and merge changes already in there
* Feature wish list [PR #232/comment](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/232#issuecomment-3155840476)
    * Update the wich list and reflect the changes in PR#232
    * Important: Passing CNCF e2e conformance & Passing the other SCS compliance checks
        * related [issue #886](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/886)
	* Move those into separate issues (as far as they are not addressed in the changes of PR 232)
	* ovn LB option to be added here: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/blob/5ce61f28fb99e7a8fd856d014ebf68f5aeae4481/providers/openstack/scs2/cluster-addon/ccm/values.yaml
	* Allowing diskful flavors [issue #223](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/issues/223) by either allowing 0 as disk size (and making sure that's handled correctly) or by having an empty default. Needs testing. scs2 currently has an empty default ...
	* 24.04 container images are used at Uhuru, so they receive testing, but we need to test the OSISM ones
	* Whitelisting IPs: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/blob/5ce61f28fb99e7a8fd856d014ebf68f5aeae4481/providers/openstack/scs2/cluster-class/values.yaml (but is it configurable?), alternative implemention at Uhuru available which should go upstream

### ECO:DIGIT project needs the KaaS from the SCS Reference Implementation on our OSISM-based environment at ScaleUp.
- Multiple clusters needed for testing Krake scheduling
- Need to find out whether having a mgmt cluster for spinning up workload clusters with CAPI is what is really needed.
	- Self-service wanted?
- Who would be willing to help setting that up?
