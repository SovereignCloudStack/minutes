#### Adopting new k8s versions

[#219](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/219)
[#184](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/184): Merged
* Supporting old versions discussion: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/184#issuecomment-1397411782
Open questions:
* Support of non-current Kubernetes versions / pace of EOL-ing
  - Proposal @garloff: Stick to upstream and require what is supported upstream (i.e. 14 months)
  - Providers can go beyond that but SCS does not require it
  - Some customers never update and thus we need to decide on forced upgrades. Customers are happy not being forced to upgrade that regularly.
  - @ajfriesen: Keep latest three version. Inform customer about deprecation.
  - @batistein: ~18 months of support, then forced to upgrade.
  - Unmaintaned old versions are in the responsibility of the customer.
  - Proposal as common ground: Ensure that there is transparancy about how providers handle k8s maintainance.
  - Warning as minimum?
  - AI @garloff: Write a note about the minimal common ground to foster transparency for the customers.
* @AI garloff: Open PR to stabilize scs-0210-v1-k8s-new-version-policy.mv
  - Give a week grace period
  - Send out mail to gather feedback and make community aware of ADR
* Responsibilities provider vs. customer: Postponed

#### Standard storage class (CSI)

[#213](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/213)
[#170](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/170)
* Not waiting for performance tiers to be defined (but stick to inexpensive, distributed, low/medium performance wording)
* Not mandating encryption at rest
  - If we don't want to enforce encryption at rest for our default storage class, we maybe want to require to have an additional storage class that supports encryption
  - Shouldn't we rather require an external security certificate (e.g. ISO-27001?) that requires to have encrypted disks and disposing disks is safe? This discussion may dislead customers.
  - Proposal: Don't get blocked and move on. Wait for feedback on encryption and reiterate.
* AI @garloff: Open PR to stabilize scs-0210-v1-k8s-new-version-policy.md
  - Give two weeks grace period
  - Send out mail to gather feedback and make community aware of pending ADR
* Merge as Draft, goal to stabilize by +2 weeks, @garloff to send mail

#### Preserving client IP in load balancer (research)

[#227](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/227)
* Headers/Proxy protocol options [#250](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/250)
  - Resolve issue that local traffic will be rejected (due to missing proxy headers): https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/issues/184
    * This need further works and is only a particular solution. We need real L3 load balancing to solve this generally.
  - Requires configuration on receiving side (patching nginx deployment yaml), thus can't be default
    * Opt-in for ingress (gateway) possible

* True L3 LB possible [#251](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/251)?
  - Not with amphora driver (acc. to @horazont): https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/251#issuecomment-1400032885
  - ovn?: Still under research. Let's discuss this again in the future.

* Standardization options: Requiring traffic working and IP preservation from LB generally?
  - (a) Both (requires L3 LB)
  - (b) Traffic flow work MUST, IP preservation SHOULD, must then provide an option for workarounds (proxy proto, "Forwarded" headers, ...)?
  - (c) Avoid traffic working without IP preservation
  => Wait for more research on the L3 LB issue and discuss again next week.

#### Technical Preview for k8s-v1.26.x

[#315](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/315)
* Node images are available and CNCF tests (and rolling upgrades and clusterctl move tests) have passed
* 1.26.x is not yet officially supported by capi: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-
openstack#compatibility-with-cluster-api-and-kubernetes-versions
  - Tracking issue: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/issues/7672

* However, we should provide customers the possibility to test upcoming versions but warn them about lacking support
* How to best warn that TechPreview is not production ready?
  - Error out if the users requests version 1.26.x but add a paramter --allow-preview-versions to request a TP

#### Registry work https://input.osb-alliance.de/p/2023-scs-registry-work

* Review registry options (dNation)
  - Not started yet 
* TODO @garloff, @mpilka: Write user stories

#### k8s-cluster-api issues

* [#321](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/issues/321)
* [#322](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/322)

#### Requirements session with GXFS

* Goal of this session was to better understand the requirements of the GXFS project. 
* Schedule another session for a technical deep dive: @joshmue, @itrich, @garloff, @batistein, @janiskemper (AI @garloff)

#### Access to k8s API limitation

[#246](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/issues/246)
