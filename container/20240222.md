### RC1 (@jschoone/@B1) 
- We prepared some Cluster Stacks for the RC, which can be found [here](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/releases/tag/openstack-alpha-1-28-v3)
    - They are still in very early state and there are some medium and many smaller things to fix, one is for example the secret in the workload cluster, see [the following item](https://input.scs.community/2024-scs-team-container?both#Entity-Responsibilities-in-Cluster-API-B1)
- There is a [Quickstart Guide](https://input.scs.community/_HeOTRCRSu2Uf2SfMSoOkQ) to use these Cluster Stacks

### Updates on KaaS V1 (@chess-knight)

    - ...
  - In progress: Upgrade guide R5 --> R6 (clusterclasses)
  - Under review: OVN LB support [#687](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/687)
  - Under review: Proxy templating optimization [#694](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/694)
- Next: migration to clusterstacks

### Updates on CSO/CSMCTL/CSPO (@Syself/@dNation)
- CSO
  - in progress: cluster addons in multiple stage process (e.g. cilium-cni)
- CSMCTL
  - some bugs have been fixed 
  - tool should be usable
  - we need to find a solution for specific providers, e.g. OpenStack provider (node-images.yaml)
      - currently, some manual steps are needed in this case
  - tool and repo will be renamed to CSCTL - [PR#77](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/csmctl/pull/77
 ) is ready for review
- CSPO
  - Under review: Add default values and override capabilities for the `cloudName` and `identityRef` fields within the OpenStackClusterStackReleaseTemplate CSPO resource - [cluster-stack-provider-openstack/PR#101](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-provider-openstack/pull/101)
  - Under review: Apply clusterstack resource once the CRDs are applied - [cluster-stack-provider-openstack/PR#93](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-provider-openstack/pull/93)
  - Ready to review: Some env variables are not needed when local_mode is enabled - [cluster-stack-provider-openstack/PR#102](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-provider-openstack/pull/102)
  - In progress: Support hash mode/custom channel in CSPO - [cluster-stack-provider-openstack/issues#99](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-provider-openstack/issues/99)

### Entity Responsibilities in Cluster-API (@B1)

The following table tries to summarize the steps that are necessary to get a running Cluster-API cluster. Also in each step there is the responsible entity who has to carry out the described action.
| Action | Responsible Entity | Example Code |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Setup/provide Management Cluster  | CSP  | `kind create cluster`   |
| Install/setup Cluster-API components  | CSP  | `clusterctl init...`  + `k apply -f cso.yaml`   |
|Create one namespace per tenant| CSP|`k create ns <tenant>`|
| Install / provide Clusterclasses per tenant | CSP  | `kubectl apply -f clusterstack-crd.yaml -n <tenant>` or `helm upgrade -i clusterstack1 clusterstack-chart -n <tenant>`|
| Provide Infra-secrets per tenant  | CSP  | `k create secret openstack -n <tenant> --from-file=clouds.yaml=clouds.yaml --from-literal=auth-url=https://api....` (clouds.yaml provides access to tenant-scoped project)   |
|CSP provides access to managementcluster/UI/central-api|CSP|`k create sa` + `k create rbac...` afterwards the CSP has to send this kubeconfig to the customer|
| Customer orders Cluster  | Customer  | `k apply -f cluster.yaml -n <tenant>`  alternatively triggered by UI/Central-API  |
| Customer gets access to the ordered Cluster  | Customer  | `k get secret...`  alternatively displayed in UI/Central-API  |
| Customer has to create a secret for OpenStack controllers  | Customer  | `k create secret...`  (we should work to make this line disappear) |

### Cloud-secret transferral from management-cluster to workload-cluster (@B1)
A crucial point currently in the progress to provide a managed k8s service with cluster-API is to automatically apply the/a secret that is used to talk to the openstack-API to order machines into the workload cluster, the workload-cluster's CCM can then use it to order loadbalancers, volumes... As it seems right now the secret does not only have to be transferred but also mangled around a bit.

Possible solutions:

"Raw-approaches"
* (currently nonexistent) extra controller (*)
* (currently nonexistent) controller in CAPO (*)
* (currently nonexistent) controller in CSPO (*)
* manual
* ClusterResourceSet (*)
* sveltos (*)


"Helm-approaches"
* sveltos (*)
* flux
* cluster-addon controller from syself (*)
* CAAPH (*)
* manual

The helm-approaches partly help with the "mangling-around" part (but then depend on their flexibility to read from sources)

Another important feature is to automatically "onboard" newly created clusters. And to update secrets. (marked with an asterisk (*) in the list )


#### Needed "mangling"

Source-format:
```yaml
#Cloud capi-testcluster in /home/ubuntu/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml:
clouds:
  openstack:
    interface: public
    identity_api_version: 3
    region_name: RegionOne
    cacert: null
    auth_type: "v3applicationcredential"
    auth:
      auth_url: https://api.gx-scs.sovereignit.cloud:5000
      project_id:
      application_credential_id:
      application_credential_secret:
```


Target-format:
```yaml
[Global]
auth-url=https://api.gx-scs.sovereignit.cloud:5000
region="RegionOne"
application-credential-id=
application-credential-secret=
tenant-id=

[LoadBalancer]
manage-security-groups=true
use-octavia=true
enable-ingress-hostname=true
create-monitor=true
```

Way to skip "mangling": force CSP to insert secret twice.
