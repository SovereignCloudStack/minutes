## :notebook: Agenda

### Status quo of Cluster Stacks 
- scope is 
  - important cluster addons that are needed to use the cluster
  - node images
  - facilitating Cluster API workflows
- current state:
  - cluster addon feature is there (not yet merged?)
  - all controllers exist
  - OpenStack integration is next project


### Status quo of existing Kubernetes layer

- management cluster is not as CAPI bootstrap cluster that is moved with clusterctl
- some settings that affect the workload clusters are options from "outside"

#### Features
- Cilium and Calico can be installed (in Cluster Stacks as cluster addon)
- deploy OCCM (in Cluster Stacks as cluster addon)
- deploy Cinder CSI (in Cluster Stacks as cluster addon)
- scripts to backup etcd (in Cluster Stacks in node image)
- deploy metrics (in Cluster Stacks as cluster addon)
- deploy nginx, gateway api, flux, harbor, etc.
  - options: CAAPH, sveltos, 
- containerd patch (we maybe set default in cluster stacks but leave option for user to configure)
  - question: does this make sense in a cluster stack? should be possible in a ClusterClass

### Vision of new Kubernetes layer
