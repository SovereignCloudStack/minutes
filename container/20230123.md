## Agenda

### Note: Repo rename (and cleanup): Docs -> standards
### Review progress on current work in progress

#### Why do we need a DCO?

We (SCS) require the DCO in order to be on the safe side, that the contributor is actually allowed to contribute.
The DCO is our preferred way (instead of having the contributors sign of a contributor license agreements)

https://docs.scs.community/docs/contribute/dco-and-licenses

#### Supported k8s versions ([#219](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/219))
* Adopting new minor versions & patches ([#184](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/184))
* Supporting old minor versions
* Upgrade responsibility
* Proposal by @garloff to have a second ADR about deprecation of old versions and for now focus on the ADR for new version
  * the SCS Standard would always require a _minimum_ a CSP is _of_course_ free to provide longer
* Maybe a third ADR on who is responsible for taking care of the version changes
* AI @garloff: Open an issue to make sure it is present for next weeks sprint planning


#### Loadbalancer discussions continued
(please dive into the issues, since they cover everything that was said in the meeting)
* Want to get client IP: [#312](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/issues/312)
	[#169](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/169) [#227](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/227)
	* Proxy protocol investigation progress [#250](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/250)
		* How do we avoid local traffic to be broken? [#184](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/issues/184)
	* L3 loadbalancer options [#251](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/251)
	  * AI @fkr: check with @matfechner on Wednesday regarding progress #251

#### Default Storage class ADR [#213](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/213)
* Done? -> to be merged, noone objects.


#### Reference implementation progress
* kubectl wait more specific in create_cluster.sh [#314](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/314)
* Dealing with k8s-v1.26 (no official support by capo yet) [#315](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/315)
  * OCCM/CSI support is there
  * tests succeeded: cncf E2E, rolling upgrade, clusterctl move
  * capo does not officially support it (yet)
    * @batistein to seek input from capi / capo about their policies to adopt new versions
  * Technical Preview status desirable and appropriate for this situation
* Upgrade default mgmnt node OS Ubu 20.04 -> 22.04 (https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/318)
  * How about node images? -> email
* Upgrade default kind v0.14.0 -> v0.17.0(k8s-v1.25.3) (https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/319)
* Default k8s version: v1.23.x -> v1.25.x ? (note: PSP gone)
* TODO: Feedback GXFS
  * IP Access management (k8s API)
  *  key management
  *  cluster authorization & authentication
  *  Service mesh
  *  Lots of standardized platform services desired
  * Observability stack (monitoring, logs, ...)
    * good candidate to be taken to SIG Monitoring, requires someone to chair the topic
	* could be someone from the companies that will work on the related container tenders
	* AI @garloff will work with the GXFS folks to work out their requirements for an observability stack (and the other wishes/requirements) to have a precise example from one consumer
	

#### Registry work https://input.osb-alliance.de/p/2023-scs-registry-work
* Review registry options (dNation)
