### SCS KaaS Standards vs. Conformance Tests

- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/982
- Cilium limitations: [#886](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/886)
- Proposal: Disable certain e2e CNCF tests to ensure real-world CNIs can pass (specifically cilium)
    - But do not list existing CNIs as being compliant, keep testing (and allow for new ones)
- Real-world security requires more than network policies (L3/L4), but there are no good cross-CNI standards yet ...
    - Beyond L3/L4 (network policies), you should look at the dataplane and have L7 (mesh), app security
    - Network policies not enabled by default in syself clusters, but can be enabled by user (by applying the custom resources) and work then
        - Maybe that should be the SCS-standards requirement?
        - Testing?
- Current standard: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0219-v1-kaas-networking.md>, test/implementation notes <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0219-w1-kaas-networking.md>
- ToDos:
    - Create blacklist of CNCF e2e network tests that need to be disabled (so Cilium and others can pass)
        - Known already, @batistein to double-check
    - Standards wording seems to not require adjustments


### Work on scs2 Cluster Stacks
* Improvements for new SCS2 [PR #232](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/232)
    * SCS2 (at PlusServer) environment currently not in perfect state (registered images stay in `saving`, loadbalancer), making testing harder
        * Ask PS to fix
        * Use Lab hardware and CiaB systems for testing
    * Testing according to [README](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/tree/scs2_cluster_stacks/providers/openstack/scs2) in scs2 directory (branch)
    * [#110](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/110/) restrict_kubeapi: Useful, but not infra-neutral, unfortunately
