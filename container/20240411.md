## :notebook: Agenda
### KaaS as topic at the SCS Hackathon (@jschoone, 10min)
- https://input.scs.community/Hy0HqULMTGeeVIcy0vmBgA#KaaS-v2-with-Cluster-Stacks
- What should be the outcome of working on KaaS at the SCS Hackathon?
- Who is interested?

### csp-helper-chart now allows arbitrary cloud name in clouds.yaml (@b1, 5min)
https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/55
https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/issues/52

[New Release 0.3.0](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/releases/download/openstack-csp-helper-v0.3.0/openstack-csp-helper-v0.3.0.tgz)

### consolidate cluster-stacks folder structure (@b1, 5min)
https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/issues/56

- How many cluster-stacks do we want to have? Can we decide on a naming convention? (stable/unstable, alpha, scs, ...)
    - Cluster Stack names should be independent of the provider
    - We need to define what exactly a Cluster Stack should do (Properties and behavior that is exposed to *users*.)
    - Several implementations (e.g. for different kind of infrastructure)
- What are  "channels" about? As far as i can see for now this is an unused field in the cluster-stack customresource.
    - Three versions require different versionen schemes to avoid collisions (e.g. hash mode in `csctl`; custom channel allows non-official versions) and to be able to decide when resources need to be rolled
        - TODO: This needs documentation / a guide
- Is it worth to maintain a new cluster-stack only for an additional addon (yawol for example)?
    - Add switch to enable/disable addons? Define addons in cluster-addon-values.yaml and control via cluster variables
    - Each combination of settings will need to be validated on the infrastructure for which those settings have been chosen

### Update on CSCTL plugin OpenStack (@michal-gubricky ~1min)
- First working iteration of CSCTL plugin OpenStack
  - build plugin binary from this [PR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/csctl-plugin-openstack/pull/4) - feel free to test it
  - in review process

---

### Update on CSPO (@michal-gubricky ~3min)
- Work in progress: Support specifying CA certificate or adding `verify: false` to clouds.yaml - [cluster-stack-provider-openstack/issues#146](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-provider-openstack/issues/146)


### End-to-end testing (Zuul) for KaaS is working again (@michal-gubricky ~3min)
- KaaS V1 e2e Zuul builds were [successful](https://zuul.scs.community/t/SCS/builds?project=SovereignCloudStack%2Fk8s-cluster-api-provider&skip=0)
- Observer and Harbor k8s clusters (both gx-scs) are green again as well
- Related metrics dashboards (observed from Harbor cluster, from last 7days, source https://monitoring.scs.community/):
  - Etcd cluster - Total leader elections (per day)![](https://input.scs.community/uploads/ae0a824d-df50-44ba-9aed-90d3108c339f.png)
  - Etcd cluster - Disk WAL fsync duration (seconds)
![](https://input.scs.community/uploads/0d28e4f4-bbb5-4eb3-8a41-0e37264914ad.png)

- For more detailed information take a look at [issue#588](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/588).

### Openstack Cluster Stacks without octavia as loadbalancer (@chess-knight ~5min)
- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/issues/48
  - [kube-vip](https://kube-vip.io/) as LB for the kube-api
  - [yawol](https://github.com/stackitcloud/yawol) as the default LoadBalancer service
- [Wooctavia cluster stacks](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/54) ready for review
  - manual steps needed
    - create VIP(network, subnet, port, router, floating IP, ...) for the kube-vip
    - create yawol image for the yawol
