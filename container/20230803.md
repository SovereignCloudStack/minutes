## :notebook: Agenda

### Standards
- [Additional Storage classes](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/214) (Encrypted)
  - Cinder CSI and Manila CSI do not support encryption
  - On what layer do we want to have the encryption?
  - What do we want to achieve? What is the threat model?
      - talk to Team IaaS about their point of view
  - aws encryption offers:
      - secret key encrypts all the data
      - kms encrypts on demand
  - Layers are probably divided in teams

### Backlog
    
- PlusServer Openstack projects
    - Would be great to push forward open [PRs](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pulls) that ask for new OpenStack projects
