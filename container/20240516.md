## :notebook: Agenda

### New cluster stack "scs"
- features of alpha and wooctavia merged in one stack

### API changes in v1beta1 of CAPO
- Minor changes in OpenstackMachine (identityRef)
- New format for ManagedSubnets (1 element list instead of map)

Does work currently due to automatic conversion, but we change to the correct spec (v1alpha7 will not be supported forever)

### Standards
- Reminder for PR review of **K8s cluster hardening**
    - please have look if you have time [!581](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/581)
