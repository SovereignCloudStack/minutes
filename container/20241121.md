## :notebook: Agenda

### Stabilize scs-0219-v1 (@mbuechse/@kgube/@tonifinger)

- [standard on docs page](https://docs.scs.community/standards/kaas/scs-0219)
- PR [standards#833](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/833)
- Approved (but limited expertise in the call)

### Node distribution standard (scs-0214)

- as for v1 (stable)
  - it seems to have been extended in error: these changes have been reverted, see [standards#834](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/834)
- as for v2 (draft)
  - we want it stabilized, but...
  - host-id label seems to run counter to k8s notions (apparently, these labels should be mainly invariant?)
  - drop any mention of this label from the standard
  - later: find a better way of checking multiple-hosts requirement
  - in the meantime: just demand an assertion by the CSP?
  - see [standards#835](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/835)
  - The test script can not do its jobs currently due to the missing `host-id` label, need to rewrod the language to make sense before stabilization
      - ToDo: Check whether we just stick to v1 then or whether we can do a quick fix for v2 (@piobig2871, @garloff)
- More generic K8s HA work (@piobig2871): issue [standards/#639](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/639), PR [standards/#806](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/806)
    - Needs renumbering (0219->0220)
    - Good work that should continue
    - Will possibly supercede 0214 some day
- External etcd (or even redis) is possible (and does not contradict any of our standards)
