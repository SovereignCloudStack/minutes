## :notebook: Agenda

### Node distribution standard
- Agreement that at least having different hypervisor hosts for control plane nodes (VMs)
    - Different failure zones or availability zones is even better (k8s failure zones may or may not correspond to infra AZs) is even better, but different hosts is a good start and very useful
        - Avoiding single machine failures (RAM, PSU) or trouble in case of host maintenance (firmware, hypervisor updates)
    - Different regions typically not a good idea (due to latency issues)
- Difficulty in testing
    - If there are different failure zones => done
    - If there are not, we'd need to look at hosts
        - Information unavailable in k8s, SCS idea for `host-id` in capi was not supported (due to live-migration considerations)
        - Live-migrations discussion
            - Label would be wrong after LM
                - We have no way to detect it and update labels (and labels are not supposed to change)
            - We could ignore this (the same anti-affinity rules are still honored by the OpenStack scheduler during a LM)
            - Control plane nodes should not be live-migrated anyway
                - We unfortunately have no way for users to communicate "don't live migrate this VM" to infra operator
                    - Flavors with local storage (e.g. `SCS-2V-4-20s`) are not live-migrated by many infra operators (e.g. PS)
                    - Standardization is work for the future
                - [Potential problems](https://lists.openstack.org/archives/list/openstack-discuss@lists.openstack.org/thread/FWZ3ACZYRB2ZFFIR3RPH5R44CGPZYEHR/#UY2CA5ZIOWCZYYPXM53ILPENSUIDT4MT) with live-migrating etcd
    - Idea is to handle this now via the plugin mechanism to create clusters for testing
        - Information is available there and can thus be put into a custom label or `ConfigMap` ... for the test script to consume
- Standard [scs-0214-v2](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0214-v2-k8s-node-distribution) has been approved and stabilized, is part of KaaS-v1
- Tests need [work](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0214-w1-k8s-node-distribution-implementation-testing)

### Improving documentation structure for ClusterStacks
- Working with partners shows what is open
- Improvements will hit docs.scs.community soon [PR#283](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/283)
    - Including kamaji
    - Including working around missing octavia (yaook)
        - octavia expected to be available in yaook soon

### Support for self-signed certs
- capo works
- cacert not forwarded to cloud.conf, so no LBs can be created (e.g. for ingress) by occm, no PVs (cinder-csi)
- issue to be opened by @jschoone against csp-helper-chart:
