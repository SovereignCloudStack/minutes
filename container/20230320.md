## Agenda
### R4: Anything left to be done?
* etcd defrag [PR k8s-capi/#401](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/401)
    * Risk assessment of current code?
        * Defrag only done on non-leaders (15' time window, randomized during the night)
        * No defragmentation happening if there are no leader changes
        * Stochastically concurrent defrag of non-leaders could happen
    * -> R4 (v5.0.0), maintained/v5.0.x, maintained/v5.x, R5 (v6.0.0)?
    * @chess-knight suggests to not include this change in the release
        * since people are on vacation, this lacks resources to test this rather large change properly
    * scenario: 
    * scenario: if we have one leader, two followers with NO leader change for a long time, does this have a negative impact on cluster performance since no fragementation is done on the leader or is this a problem, because at some point we *will* reach the limits on the leader.
        * Document this
        * @joshmue: "isn't this fixed by the compaction (and not de-fragmentation)?"
        * @jschoone: "since we already have the defragmentation on the non-leader nodes, we should definitly keep that"
    * This should be revisited during R5 cycle
    
* Final touches [release notes](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/blob/main/Release-Notes-R4.md)?
    * Release date 2024 -> 2023 ... (@garloff)
    * Mention `cilium_binaries` setting (@chess-knight)
    * Mention `calico_version` being per-cluster now (@chess-knight)
    * Comment regarding the k8s versions (@jschoone)
        * any highlights that need to be added?
        * 1.25 pod security policies are mentioned
    * Flavors?
        * mention changed defaults (@garloff)
    * Registry (harbor) ADR work should be mentioned (@chess-knight)
    * Double-check docs.scs.community completeness and remove OLD_README.md
        * Quick-Start (@jschoone) and Getting started (@jschoone) need completion
        * Comparison & Removal of OLD_README: @garloff
        *

### Ubuntu 22.04
* [upstream issue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder/issues/1080) closed
    * New images can be rebuilt and test with the latest [upstream](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder) version
    * too late now, this is documented in the release notes and will be part of R5
    * could be enabled very early in R5 cycle as opt-in, with it becoming default in R5

### Standards

#### Registry
* [standards/#212](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/212): ADR - Requirements for container registry
    * Open questions ([shared-storage model in Harbor](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/discussions/294); [container registry use cases](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/discussions/295)) also as GitHub discussions
        * No further response from CSPs
* [k8s-harbor/#23](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-harbor/issues/23): Investigation of Harbor deployment possibilities
    * PR (draft) [standards/#251](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/251) - ADR Harbor deployment
        * Decision -> depends on use cases we want to support
            1. whole container registry instance as-a-service per user -> Harbor Operator makes sense here
            2. multitenant deployment - container registry project (tenant) as-a-service per user -> Harbor Helm Chart makes sense here
* Test Harbor deployment available here: https://harbor.scs.dnation.cloud/
    * Harbor Helm Chart
    * HA mode for all components
    * Deployed on the top of k8s cluster (scs-k8s-capi) & SCS infrastructure (plusserver, p500924-harbor project)
    * ToDo: OIDC integration; https://registry.scs.community/ migration
    * Final destination needs to be defined (after we learned and documented how to do integration and migration):
        * maybe the community hardware is going to be a good place?
        * or the wavestack project
