## :notebook: Agenda

### Developments regarding capi image name (@mbuechse)

- see Issue [cluster-stacks/#156](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/issues/156)
- scs-0102-v1: image name with space is indeed merely a recommendation, and it only applies to plain OS images
- openstack-image-manager: currently can't do anything but space, but [issue to change that](https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/issues/821) is already being worked on

### Cluster Stacks on Hetzner Baremetal (@chess-knight)
- Current development of the Cluster Stacks available here: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/125
- Yaook implementation can be found in [yaook_hetzner branch](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/tree/feat/yaook_hetzner)
- HetznerBareMetalHost must/should be prepared using CAPH before applying the cluster resource (bare metal hosts need to be bought out-of-band)

### Improvement of Docs (@DEiselt, @jschoone)

* Epic: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/issues/232
    * Feedback welcome
