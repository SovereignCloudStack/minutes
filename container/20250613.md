## :notebook: Agenda
### Merge PRs in CSO (@jschoone)
#### Merge [CSO#294](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-operator/pull/294)
- even with failing linter to get newest builder version for other PRs
- @jschoone did a research what is wrong with PRs
    - golang linter `golangci.yaml` has to be migrated to the v2
    - attempt to do that leads with lot of linter v2 issues in the code base
        - it seems that the linter v2 complains repeatedly about similar issues in the code
            - we will try to resolve them
#### Fix/migrate golangci.yaml to v2
- done in [CSO#295](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-operator/pull/295) via `golangci migrate`
~~- AI: fix Makefile, replace --out-format~~

### Cluster Stacks (@jschoone)
- start with the new Cluster Stacks discussed [last Container Call](https://input.scs.community/2025-scs-team-container?both#Add-new-Cluster-Stacks-series-jschoone)
- Discussion about: Random name, will use "quokka" here
    - Result from 2025-05-30 CC meeting: (@matofeder, @garloff): Use `scs2` to message that this is *the* officially vetted CS series
    - @jschoone: Could be confusing to use scs2 - `2` could confuse users
        - Cluster Stacks name will be then
            - new: `openstack-scs2-1-33-v1`
            - old was: `openstack-scs-1-33-v1`
        - As we have `-` between `<provider>-<CSname>-<K8Sversion>-<CSversion>` it is not hard to distinguish the "things" in the name
    - Result of discussion: We all agreed that `scs2` is suitable as a "new" name of CS 
- [CS#225](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/225) won't me merged into `scs` but will be move to `scs2`
- do not add new features like additionalBlockDevice and Gateway API to `scs` but only to `scs2`
    - only upgrade Kubernetes patch versions for `scs`
- AI: copy-paste scs to scs2, include features which already have PRs (additionalBlockDevice, clouds.yaml)

### ORC-related fixes (@matofeder)
- wrong properties (`hardware`) [#227](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/227)
- capo can only wait for a reference to orc image resource, not an OpenStack image name [#229](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/229)
- fix this for old `scs` and new `scs2`
	
### Gateway API in KaaS v2 (@garloff)
- How to get Gateway API working? Opt-In? Opt-Out? for `scs2`
	- No need for a switch
	- Deploy CRDs ahead of cilium via an cluster add-on
		- Add to umbrella chart (in helm `crds` or templates dir)
			- CRDs in crd directory are not upgraded by `helm upgrade`, but cluster stack operator handles this for us by removing and reinstalling
				- The CRDs could be in use then make the upgrade fail
		- Alternative approach: Use separate helm chart for the CRDs
	- Have cilium take over kube-proxy
- Is the traction of Gateway API good enough?
    - It seems that yes: see list of implementations: https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/
- AI: add to `scs2`
