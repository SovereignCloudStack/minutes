### Start with R5
- What to take over from R4
    - Lots of standardization topics: [slides 21--24](https://scs.sovereignit.de/nextcloud/apps/files/?dir=/Sovereign%20Cloud%20Stack/Presentations/Alasca-202302&openfile=162153)
    - [See Planning](https://www.figma.com/file/xmZ7newzY5E5NdxjHQS09S/R5---OUTCOMES?node-id=191-277&t=fN1Mqd3YZoLFilfZ-0)
    - Load-Balancer for ingress, PR [k8s-capi/#407](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/407) - Roman, Kurt
    - Support custom CA in k8s-capi ref-impl (epic) issue [k8s-capi/#372](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/issues/372) - Matej, Jan
    - More issues from the backlog ...
- Create epics and stories for R5
  - mostly in pairing sessions
  - top topics from Retro and Planning
      - e2e tests
          - nightly (or PR driven) runs
          - extend coverage (e.g. ingress, storage, ...)
          - "From zero to cluster" `make sonobuoy`
      - CI
          - prow
          - clusterapi e2e test framework
      - observability
          - epic is in ops team
      - Easy Getting Started/Quickstart guides
          - It's easy only currently if you already have access to an OpenStack env (one which does *not* use a custom CA, see above #372)
          - Trouble is this access for *some*, improve by:
              - Documenting how to get access to running SCS or to set up an own testbed, CiaB (or other easy SCS-like IaaS)
              - Support alternative capi providers
          - Solution depends who the target group (*some*) is
              - Providers managing clusters
                  - Needs to be capi-based or capi-like to somehow reflect our lifecycle management 
              - DevOps person managing workloads on k8s clusters
                  - Cluster properties may be comparable/standardized even if you do build the clusters very differently (even kind)
      - More focus on other providers than OpenStack
          - standards!
          - ref.impl.?
          - Possible providers
              - CAPI Docker (CAPD)
              - CAPI KubeVirt (CAPK)

### Service Mesh
- should we provide a Service Mesh deployment?
    - cluster class with and without service mesh

Dropped from standardization upstream?
SM wanted from GXFS

-> Needs more discussion
