## Agenda
* Thank you!
* R3 recap:
    * Standardization: 
        - Discussions on IaaS-neutral Cluster Management (even without hard requirement for CAPI)
        - Standard  features/setup/requirements of k8s cluster themselves (storage, anti-affinity, ...)
        - => TODO: Write down blueprints / ADR proposals, alignment with larger CNCF world

    * Ref. Implementation: (See release notes: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/blob/main/Release-Notes-R3.md)
        - Usual upgrades (capi, capo, kind, calico, cilium, nginx, ....)
        - harbor: update, recover registry.scs.community
        - Per-cluster application credentials
        - generation counter in parameter file
        - certificate rotation (documentation)
        - create Upgrade Guide (WIP), Maint&Troubleshooting Guide (WIP)
        - etcd maintenance
        - => TODO: 
            * kubeAPI throttling (#155)
            * ACLs on kubeAPI access (#246)
            * Doc completion
            * cert rotation: `kubeadm certs renew` as timer?
            * other "production quality" questions
            * Need requirements for good etcd VM (local storage, SSD required?) -> add new mandatory SCS flavor(s)? -> Kurt to find slot (tentative: Oct 10, 15:05 CEST)
            * IPv6 support (ingress and kubeapi) (#296)
               - Standardization req. for IaaS (IPv4 with floating-ip not standardized yet either, although best practice on 90+% of clouds) -> issues/#166, #167

     * Backup & Restore strategy needed (otherwise live upgrade considered too risky by many users) (#297)

*  Plan forward
    * RefImpl:
        - Optional Integrate harbor deployment (optional!)
        - Lose ends ("prod. quality", ACLs. throttling, Docs)
        - General CA handling (@horazont, #253)
    * Standardization
        - Write down proposals and start broader discussions
        - Conformance tests (test driven standardization?)
        - Participants: @batistein, @ajfriesen, @mxmxchere, @horazont, @joshmue/master-caster/o-otte
            - => separate apptmt, not standardization SIG slot if we want C&H

    * Alignment RefImpl & (upcoming) Standards
