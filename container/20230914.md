## :notebook: Agenda
### State of e2e testing
- SCS Zuul works
- Some differences between SCS Zuul and testing Zuul instance lead to adjustments in the configuration
- Probably a requirement for the test should be added to prevent merging before the test finished successfully
    - Need some adjustments as this will be a requirement for every PR, even those which aren't code changes
- Nightly builds will come soon
- For our conformance test we will try do add badges using the [Zuul Badges](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/howtos/badges.html)

### Standardization
- [#226](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/226) Anti-Affinity for Kubernetes nodes
- [#386](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/386) K8s version support period
- Will be discussed at the beginning of the next release

## Cluster Stacks
- Work on [Cluster Stack Operator](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-operator) almost done

## Release
- Currently open PRs regarding Zuul/e2e will be merged and then the `main` branch can be tagged for the rc2
