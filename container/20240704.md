### moin-cluster monitored under monitoring.scs.community (@michal-gubricky, mxmxchere)
- Check it out: https://monitoring.scs.community
- Logs also available
- Good examples for "living" SCS-paradigm open operations
- AI: check if secrets are exposed somehow

### k8s version policy qa (@frosty-geek)
[scs-0210-v2-k8s-version-policy](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0210-v2-k8s-version-policy): how do CSP do QA of patch releases to stay within the 1 week after release requirement? 
- PSKE needs to pass 5 stages, where every stage takes around one day

ref implementation (cluster-stacks) is lacking an automated release tracking mechanism completely (no issue with a too long process currently)

Standard in one point recommends only a 2 day upgrade window. Good testing not realistically possible in that timeframe.

Depends on how much you "trust" kubernetes release-team to do only non-breaking stuff in patch-releases

Syself testing approach:
- cluster creation test
- looking at the logs
- some automatic scripts
- upgrade test
- some manual steps

Are there version policies for other components?

### News from Cluster Stack Operator (@janiskemper)
- Multi-stage cluster addons work now and are released
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/
- documentation missing, but examples should be enough
- AI @Syself: Prepare demo for 2024-07-11
- Single use case for cilium? Currently 
- is the cilium operator capable of doing an upgrade?
    -> no upgrade process has to take place outside of the operator
