### Ingress and Loadbalancing (issues/#227)
* issues/#251: octavia ovn provider appears to be providing wanted L3 LB functionality
  - Available on gx-scs, pco, not on wavestack (ovn not used)
    * ovn (open virtual network) not as mature as ovs (open vSwitch)
      - don't want to mandate it now
      - work on it in the IaaS team
      - SCS workloads are mostly k8s/container based, so the focus should be to enable container workloads as good as possible and not necessarily support legacy workloads perfectly.
  - Needs testing
  - Needs enablement in capo, occm
  - @garloff started adding support for OVN LBs in OpenStack Health Monitor but not succeeded
  - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/openstack-health-monitor/tree/feat/lb-provider-flavor
  - needs further investigation, AI @garloff to create a user story - so that someone from the team can pick it up

* issues/#250: proxy protocol as fallback (for ovs) users?
  - Will not be a generic solution (but work for the SCS-managed nginx-ingress)
  - Resolve local traffic issue? (k8s-cluster-api-provider/#184)
  - hostname setting (k8s-cluster-api-provider/#323)
  - Question by @matfechner: is it possible to make use of istio to preserve the original IP?
    * A: envoy is used as ingress in the istio use case
      - Service mesh is another level of complexity that we don't want to force upon everyone
    * gateway API (https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) will most probably replace ingress
      - single most enabled feature in the cases where we provided clusters was ingress (raised by @garloff, upon the remark wether ingress is really that important - since it will likely be deprecated in favor of gateway api)
    * ambient mesh using quic will broaden the mesh options, like quic or http/3 https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9114.html
  - Trouble is that there are many ingress options, having one may not suit everyone

* PO proposal:
  * (a) have a *recommendation* (SHOULD) to have L3 LB which enables all ingresses/gateway implementations without further annotations (maybe we can make it mandatory at some time in the future)
  * (b) have *one* ingress/gateway implementation always (mandatory for providers) that users can opt-in to that is implemented such that client IPs are preserved
  * Closely follow establishment of gateway API
  * Agreement in room, AI @garloff: write Architecture Decision Record, @mpilka to support

### Standards in stabilization
* Standard storage class (standards/#198): Goal 2023-02-13
  - More discussions needed, e.g. external?
* New version adoption speed (standards/#201): Goal 2023-02-06
  - Wording changes from @joshmue/@garloff
  - Broader discussion needed? New timeline?
  - Add one day to resolve improvements (AI @garloff)

### Container registry
* Research story issues/#263 (Written update via chat)
  - @chess-knight did some research about Harbor
  - @matofeder continues investigating other alternatives (kraken, dragonfly ...)
  - AI @matofeder: write an ADR
