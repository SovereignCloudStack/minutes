## Agenda
* Merged:
    * Image metadata conformance: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/278
    * harbor
    - Incomplete
    - Write permission to repo missing (github-manager is WIP)
* Need reviews on final *default* version upgrades
  * capi-1.2.1 -> 1.2.2: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/274
  * nginx-ingress-1.1.2 -> 1.3.0  https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/276
  * cert-manager-1.7.1 -> 1.9.1 https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/277
* Need discussion:
    * etcd tweaks: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/279
    - ETCD_UNSAFE_FS as default
      - barrier=0 for filesystem -- better lose a node in crash than not having a stable multi-node cluster
      - No agreement for this, single-node etcd is a valid option, especially on ceph 
        - don't enable per ETCD_UNSAFE_FS per default
        - better use higher heartbeat_interval
        - geo-replicated setting (@batistein) could help as well
      - ceph can not guarantee the write latencies required for etcd; tuning: fast CPUs on OSDs, dedicated network, SSDs
      - local SSD would be the best solution => require at least one flavor with local SSD/NVMe in the future?
    - Move from patching manifests/etcd.yaml to KubeadmControlPlane.spec.kubeadmConfigSpec.clusterConfiguration.etcd.local.extraArgs in cluster-template
   * Suspicious need for etcd restart:  https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/281
    - @batistein to support with review
* Need work:
    * etcd maintenance (defrag): https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/282
    - Avoid crashing capo
    - numeric extraArgs need quoting as strings 
    - Use clean file injection
* Later
    * kubeapi throttling -> document as known limitation in release notes
* Multi Cluster Ideas and concepts according Tim Hockin  https://speakerdeck.com/thockin/multi-cluster-past-present-future (video will need another month?)
    * Multi-cluster setup vision
    * kubefed-v1/-v2 failing: why?
    * Inter-cluster comm via CNI (cilium), multi-cluster ingress
      -> clusterset concept
    * could start a discussion with Tim, Vadim to establish connection if wanted
* Other TODOs:
    * LICENSE file cleanup
    * Write upgrading guide
