## :notebook: Agenda

### Standardization (@cah-hbaum (needs to go at 11:00))
- [K8s cluster hardening](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/581)
    - previously "K8s cluster baseline security"
    - ready to review, will do some more small changes (and big changes if requested by the reviews)
    - complete rewrite, feedback highly appreciated

### kube-apiserver certSANs configurable now
https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/79
 - Useful if you want custom Subject Alternative Names in your kube-apiserver cert
 -> oidc config is next on the list
 
### Merge wooctavia and alpha to scs
work in Progress. https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/81/commits
1st Part (configuration of loadbalancer for the API-server) works
2nd Part (configuration of the loadbalancer for the workload-cluster) is 
next

### A (modern) productive cluster (@scoopex)
moin-cluster with testing/playing around scope?
-> stuff described below is already in place at the moin-cluster, productive usage is unlikely due to underlying IaaS issues at gx-scs. <-- what kind of issues at gx-scs? are they addressed? (@berendt) slow storage, no real local storage

prod-cluster for things we rely on, might help us to gain knowledge about behaviour when actually used, dogfooding

A productive/modern cluster with clusterstacks/cluster-api would probably be a good thing.

modern: using our _current_ cluster-stacks approach.

Is that meant as a management cluster or a workload cluster?
- Could be created as a workload cluster from the moin cluster


**Motivation**

* Practical experience in long-term, day by day operation of the new k8s clusters (dog-fooding)
* Have a productive cluster to improve observability mechanisms
* Run productive SCS infrastructure
    * Keycloak: Identity brokered with Github, used for our infrastructure systems and the scs landscape
    * Central Monitoring: Move monitoring.scs.community to that instance, federate i.e. with the scs landscape
    * The future scs website
    * Health Check Infrastructure: ???
    * Standards Compliance Service
    * Statuspage: Use it for our infrastructure
    * Potentally move other existing services to that cluster (Mailman, Jitsi, Habor, Hedgedoc, ...)
        
**Implementation ideas**

* Establish a small team which is reponsible for the cluster
* Use dedicated namespaces for every application
* Perform gitops deployments using ArgoCD or Flux
* Add a wildcard DNS entry for the loadbalancer ip
* Use OIDC Auth with Keycloak (which is federated with Github)
* Permission management: Grant repsonsible engineers for these namespaces
* Establish runbooks/documentation for all hosted applications to simplify the maintenance and to decouple applications from specific persons
* Run that cluster on a project on the productive plusserver environment

### Move Cluster Stack management
- CSO must exists on target management cluster
- ClusterStackRelease must be ready
    - ClusterClass exists

### ClusterClass support for Metal3 and kamaji
- almost supported in Metal3 (waiting for release)
- not supported in kamaji currently 

### How to adress inconsistencies between cluster-classes
-> keep the number of clusterclasses low
-> "Main"-clusterclass for generic option
-> "special"-clusterclasses that should "implement/include (OOP word is extend i guess)" the mainclass

-> no final answer found yet
-> cluster-api objects are not kubernetes version dependant (folder per k8s-version necessary for the cluster-class?)
