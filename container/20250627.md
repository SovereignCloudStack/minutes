### Progress on Gateway API
- Hoping for progress from @jschoone

### CSO: dependency update for Cluster Addons
-  @jschoone was able to fix the problems in the PRs and merged them. Then @jschoone started to add the --dependency-update flag to Helm in the CSO: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-operator/pull/296
- CSO image available [here](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-operator/pkgs/container/cso-staging/442366067?tag=sha256-8b036ef7314efbbc60f3143af985754439d7921d359c1b880f2120180f7c82cd.sig)
	- The CSO image is not tested yet
- Discussion on what is achieved by [#296](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-operator/pull/296)
  	- Does it pull in the "latest and greatest" versions from dependencies? That would break the value proposition of Cluster Stack delivering something that is defined and has been validated ...
  	- Does it allow us to get rid of the tarballs in the CS add-ons?
	- Conclusion from @matofeder: It pulls in the dependencies as defined by the versions in the CS, so it should do what we want ...
- TODO: Testing.
	- Deploy CSO with the above CSO image
	- Create a CS test release without the tarballs and see whether it works

### Octavia OVN as default LB for scs2 CS
- More lightweight and much less often hitting `PENDING_[CREATE|UPDATE]` states
- yaook does support octavia-amphora now, not (yet?) octavia-ovn
	- See if this can be addressed prior to switching defaults
	- (but maybe not a hard requirement)
