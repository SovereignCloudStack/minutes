## Agenda

### Quick intro to work by Team OPS & SIG Monitoring on Observability for KaaS
(@o-otte will do this)

https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/291

* Discussed issues/#306 in SIG Monitoring
* Would it make sense to ask customers?
    * This is currently only about CSPs

### Registry
* https://registry.scs.community/ 
    *  Harbor deployment (harbor-helm v1.6.x) affected by [security issue](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/security/advisories/GHSA-j7jh-fmcm-xxwv)
        *  it is possible for anyone to forge the JWT token and push/pull images in Harbor without any authentication
    * Migrate to the patched version harbor-helm v1.11.1 ASAP, @chess-knight already started with the [k8s-harbor upgrade process](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-harbor/compare/main...postgres-test) - PR will take place soon 
    * We will stick with the version and migrate to the new instance next week

### scs-k8s-capi/ SCS infra
* dNation is not able to create/manage k8s clusters on SCS infra (using scs-k8s-capi), because of LB issues (full report will be created soon)
    * Kubeadm init/join command can not access (timeout) the k8s API through its LB (FIP) 
    * It could be related to the [5.0.0: Connection problems to FIPs using neutron_ovn_distributed_fip=true with ovn 22.09 and ovs 3.0.1](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/490)
* PlusServer sent the information this should be fixed by Thursday
* AI: dNation create a new issue with the error messages

### Spring cleaning
* Since there is no regular meeting next week due to Easter Monday, we went over [the board](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/7) to clean up the _Done_ column.
    * Archived issues
    * moved issues to better fitting columns
    * reassigned tasks
