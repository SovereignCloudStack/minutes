### Tests for recently stabilized standards (@mbuechse)

- final missing puzzle piece for the new certificate scope SCS-compatible KaaS, see [standards/#484](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/484), to be stabilized on 2024-02-29!
- [scs-0214-v1](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0214-v1-k8s-node-distribution): Kubernetes Node Distribution and Availability
    - test script relies on node labels:
        - `topology.kubernetes.io/region`
        - `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`
        - `kubernetes.io/hostname`
    - if labels not present: only emit warning (standard doesn't mandate them)
    - please approve [PR standards/#486](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/486)
    - apparently, the reference implementation does set these labels
    - also, we use anti-affinity
    - HOWEVER, the hostname is not the hostname of the hypervisor, but just for the pod(?), so it's not telling us what we need
        - CAPO does track the underlaying infrastructure host ("hypervisor"), probably we have unique identifiers for other CAPx solutions - information is available in management cluster
        - non-CAPI based solutions may need different ways
        - would need to require setting a label (e.g. `XXX/physicalhost`) with a hypervisor identifier (`XXX` may not be `topology.kubernetes.io`) 
- [scs-0210-v2](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0210-v2-k8s-version-policy): Kubernetes version policy
    - standards mandates to support any officially supported Kubernetes (minor) versions -- currently 1.27, 1.28, 1.29 --; these versions have to be kept up to date
    - test script expects one cluster per Kubernetes (minor) version and then checks whether its up-to-date (this part is similar to what the test script for v1 did)
    - please approve [PR standards/#488](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/488)
    - future enhancement: We know how to create clusters for KaaS-v1 and -v2(cluster stacks), so develop an option to create test clusters on the fly (via a plugin mechanism, so third parties could contribute a plugin for their KaaS) as opposed to requiring long-running clusters from operators
- related issue:
    - Call for providers to supply k8s clusters for testing purposes, similar to the OpenStack projects (in particular, gx-scs)
        - Managed KaaS, where provider keeps the clusters up-to-date
        - syself, REGIO
        - Stop-gap measure: Run our own (on e.g. gx-scs) short-term to validate the tests
            - Keeping them updated would be a manual task in our current setup
    - Alternatively include conformance test as a task into the existing e2e test job on zuul
        - YES, please do this
- preview: SCS-compatible KaaS **v2**
    - I'd like to discuss how to incorporate the CNCF k8s conformance test into our certification/test regime
    - either run the test, which seems to take 2 hrs
    - or find a way to fetch the latest result

### Test reports of RC1 (@jschoone)
- do we have some?
    - @matofeder tested with new cspo successfully
- need more testing!!!

### ClusterResourceSet to get secret into workload clusters (@mxmxchere, @jschoone)
- How to inject `cloud.conf`/`clouds.yaml` for the the workload cluster, so occm & cinder-csi work?
    - ClusterResourceSet: Wrapping it into a secret in the mgmt cluster and transfer to Workload cluster
    - CSO is taking over this responsibility (TBD)
- By default, the workload clusters will inherit the project and credentials from the management cluster (KaaS v1 creates one app credential per workload cluster in that same project)

### CSPO v0.1.0-alpha.2 (dNation)

### OpenStack new tenant/project hook?
Is it possible / a good idea to trigger a cluster-API per tenant chart automatically?

### KaaS Hackathon (last meeting before) (@jschoone)
- Whishes for the [Agenda](https://input.scs.community/yrVXQ4-tRlODXI4Ic8FfQg#Agenda)?
