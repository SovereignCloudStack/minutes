## Move Appointment
- Container Review and Planning/Meeting will be moved to Wednesday
    - Wed, 12:05 CEST? (Would move IAM meeting then.)
        - starting next week (cwk 30)
        - lunch break conflict for on-premise workers

## Agenda
### Finish Cluster Stack presentation
* Reference implementation is opinionated -- you need to use cluster-API to benefit from reference implementation
* Standard-compliance (SCS-compatible) should be possible even without CAPI
    * Cluster Standards can be fulfilled
    * Cluster-Management Standards may be a challenge
* ClusterClasses are smarter than upstream
    * Upstream contribution desirable!
    * Upstream concepts may not match 100%
        * Should changes to a class affect running (production) clusters?
* Operator running on the management cluster
    * manages objects in workload cluster (e.g. CNI, ...)
    * add-ons according to this proposal? https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/docs/proposals/20220712-cluster-api-addon-orchestration.md
        * Update challenge?
        * Design decision disagreement ...
        * Reevaluate -> Attempt to align with upstream and explicitly expose disagreements (if they still exist after discussions)
    * [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) not recommended for production ...
    * `clusterctl move`-like move of operator to production management cluster (from bootstrap management cluster created with kind or the like) will be implemented

## Standards
- [#288](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/288) Write tests for standard "Offered K8s version recency"
    - standard: [scs-0210-v1-k8s-new-version-policy.md](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0210-v1-k8s-new-version-policy.md)
    - issue has been refined
        - quite some effort to obtain and parse Kubernetes versions and open CVEs -- warranted?
            - feed with k8s versions in json works nicely
            - CVEs are more difficult, as the versions there sometimes diverge in format
        - => Code that works for stds conformant pieces is there and works
            - Let's review this and react once we find divergence (by giving feedback or by improving our parser)
            - Can we leverage [trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) (from aquasecurity) instead?
    - [PR 318](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/318) ready -- *please review*!
- [#289](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/289) Write tests for standard "Default storage class properties"
    - standard: [scs-0211-v1-kaas-default-storage-class.md](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0211-v1-kaas-default-storage-class.md)
    - issue has been refined a bit (together with @joshmue and @fkr)
        - support for access mode ReadWriteOnce will be tested
            - Does [sonobuoy](https://sonobuoy.io/) already have tests for this?
                - Possibly extend it ...
                - AI @jschoone: Schedule session with @tonifinger, @cah_baum (and @matofeder/@chess-knight and @garloff to support) to introduce [k8s-cluster-api-provider](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/) and its tools
        - no sure way to test the following (ideas welcome):
            - volume must be protected against data loss due to hardware failures of a single disk or host
                - Hard to do
            - volume must not be bound to the lifecycle of a Kubernetes Node
                - Idea: roll nodes (rolling upgrade of capi) or kill node VM to test
