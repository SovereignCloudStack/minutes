## :notebook: Agenda
### Review Montreal, Planning Nantes
#### Review Montreal

* [Board of Montreal](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/35?filterQuery=label%3A%22container%22++iteration%3AMontreal)

#### Planning Nantes

* [Board of Nantes](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/35?filterQuery=label%3A%22container%22++iteration%3ANantes+)

#### Standards

* Reminder: Pull requests that are currently open require review
    * [Update standard K8s version policy](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/334)
    * [K8s node distribution standard](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/354)
    * [K8s cluster robustness features](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/361)

#### SIG Docs

Participation welcomed :baby_chick: 

* We need an introduction text for container layer answering the following questions on: https://docs.scs.community/docs/category/container-layer
    * Who is the target group? 
    * What is it not?
    * Prerequisites and Requirements (knowledge, software, hardware)
    * Features, Capabilities and Limitations (k8s cluster api provider only runs on openstack)
        * how does it interact with the iaas layer?
    * current plans on implementations, roadmap and current state on clusterstacks 
        * is it worth it to implement with the outlook on clusterstacks?
        * comparison table of cluster-api-provider and cluster-stacks
        * alpha label might make sense for cluster-stacks to indicate that it's in development
    * Success Stories and Deployment Examples

https://input.scs.community/container-layer-intro-on-docs-page

* @fdobrovolny will take a care, any cooperation from team is welcomed
  
#### ClusterStacks/ClusterStack Operator

* docs will be improved, then team could cooperate easier
* Q: do we need a dedicated clusterstack operator per cloud (e.g. aws, openstack)?
    * It depends, whether node images are available and pre-build

#### [Migration to ClusterClasses in KaaS V1](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/issues/626)

* Issue will be addressed in the sprint Nantes (PR'll come soon)

#### [Renovate bot](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/issues/577)

* Updates that have already been addressed are covered by the Renovate bot:
    * CAPI/CAPO
    * [Calico](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/622)
        * [Update dependency projectcalico/calico to v3.26.3](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/623)
* How to deal with PRs opened by the Renovate bot?
    * Automate e2e label on that PRs?
        * It seems that it is possible to adjust PR description/labels from renovate,
            * CI env file could be adjusted via PR description: [Support custom zuul configs](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/610) 
        
#### [Long-term cluster](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/435) for the SCS project

* Definition of Done section has been updated
* B1 team plans to start the implementation ~~this sprint~~ after the proxy topic
* long-term cluster destination (infra): PS test env.
