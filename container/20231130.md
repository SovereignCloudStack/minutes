## :notebook: Agenda
### Team Mission
- Proposal: "We're building a streamlined platform that simplifies the management of Kubernetes clusters on various providers."
- "We want to enable OpenStack (SCS) CSPs to offer a managed k8s solution to their customers"

-> we didn't manage to talk about this because of a spontaneous addition to the agenda at the end of the meeting

### [Cluster Stack Operator Documentation](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-operator/pull/32)

-> no questions asked - general approval of the PR, apart from the topics raised in the PR as comments
 
### Cluster Stack Provider Openstack
[Milestone](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/milestone/8)
#### Epics
##### [Create Cluster Stack for Openstack](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/425)
- ClusterClass and ClusterAddons should be migrated to Cluster Stacks the way as the current Docker example

-> @mxmxchere wants to take over the Helm Charts for Cluster API resources and Cluster Addons
-> @mxmxchere and @batistein will sync regarding options to test cluster stacks with the operator
-> @NotTheEvilOne will provide notes about the node image building process in a Github issue

##### [Create Cluster Stack Provider Openstack](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/496)
-> @janiskemper will meet early next week with people to implement the provider integration (https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/496)

#### Feature/Script Migration
- Go through the scripts regarding [#Features](#Features)
- Extract scripts from [KubeadmControlPlaneTemplate](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/blob/main/terraform/files/template/cluster-template.yaml#L124-L312)

Conclusions and list of features (to be extended):
- etcd defragmentation which can be included in node images
- tweak-kubeapi-memlimit - script that computes MEM limit for kubeapi and adjust kube-apiserver.yaml accordingly. This is executed as postKubeadmCommand. 
- http settings: probably as variable into ClusterClass
- ovn lb script has some feature that we need to understand and maybe think about migrating

### [KaaS monitoring MVP-0](https://github.com/sovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability)
- [Architecture](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/blob/main/docs/images/monitoring_hybrid_mvp0.png)
- MVP-0 viable state has been already announced in the [sig-monitoring matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/!ToxwzOWTBqSjxRAwuj:matrix.org/$FgvTSRHoP2ErA3hjAIA33t55hoTGwH7R1zNdO3jIl4c?via=matrix.org&via=regio.chat&via=tchncs.de)
    - See and try an interactive demo for Monitoring of the KaaS Layer (find details in the announcement message above)

### Standards

- Use case(s) for `rwx` in https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/214
