## :notebook: Agenda
### Cluster Stacks status
* OpenStack support: [Milestone 8](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/milestone/8)
* Report from dNation-syself discussion
    * Implementation deep-dive into existing cluster-stack-openstack repo (private syself at this moment)
        * Repo needs to be transferred and published -> will happen today: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-provider-openstack>
    
### Cluster Stack demo (@jschoone)
* Ubuntu VM
    * `jq`, `docker`, `git`, `make` need to be installed
    * `git clone https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stakcs-demo`
    * `make create-bootstrap-cluster` (spins up kind management cluster with CAPI and cluster-stack CRDs in it)
    * `make create-workload-cluster` (creates another kind cluster with the docker provider)
    * `kubectl get crds`, `clusters`, `nodes` ... work as expected
    * New: `kubectl get clusterstacks`
    * Naming for clusterstacks: Needs a discussion
    * `AUTOSUBSCRIBE` feature: Get updates (`USABLE` will move from v1->v2->...)
    * `kubectl get clusterstackreleases`
    * Add-ons not yet part of the demo
    * Making upgrade v1->v2 available by editing the `clusterstack` custom resource
    * Editing cluster object (topology) will rollout the new cluster version (nothing really happening for ferrol v1->v2, as there are no new node images)
    * Assets (cluster stacks) defined in [cluster-stacks repo](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks)
    * Pointer to assets in CS operator (as secret): Currently set to github (releases), will be opened up
* Further collaboration on <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-provider-openstack>
    * Use issues, PRs, .. to further evolve the code
    * Status of initial code drop today should be good enough to produce working clusters on OpenStack
        * Fast iteration over CI was done privately before
    * Work remaining to be done (mostly by dNation + B1)
        * Pulling images
        * CNI installation
        * more v1 (SCS/cluster-api-provider-openstack) features
        * cluster-class things
        * v1 -> v2 upgrades
        * ...
    * Expect to need syself support
        * Precise split of work needs to be worked out ("project planning")
        * @jschoone to setup meeting with B1, syself, dNation
### Cluster Stack Operator docs
* [#32](https://SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-operator/pull/32) Rename Cluster-Stack-Provider-Integration into Cluster-Stack-ImageController?
    * a lot of the provider specific pieces (capX, Xccm, csi-X, ...) are in the add-ons, leaving mostly the image handling here
