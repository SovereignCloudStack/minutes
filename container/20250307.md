### SCS compliance check SCS-0219-V1 failed for Cilium CNI (@matofeder)

- [Bug#886](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/886)
  - SCS-0219-V1 standard utilizes Sonobuoy (sonobuoy --e2e-focus=NetworkPolicy) to validate the standard
  - `e2e-focus=NetworkPolicy` may be too broad and extend beyond the SCS-0219-V1 standard
    - sonobuoy --e2e-focus=NetworkPolicy executes 54 tests. 3 of them failed due to lack of Cilium support
      - Cilium [e2e pipeline skips these 3 as well](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/main/.github/workflows/k8s-kind-network-policies-e2e.yaml#L172)
      - Ongoing work on cilium (9029), syself involved, not considered bugs (but unsupported features)
      - So we should probably give waivers for these 3 features in our standard and exclude them from the test

### Regular maintenance for SCS Cluster-Stacks

- Provide patch updates regularly which are tested
- Multi-stage addons and just-file contributed which would help this
- Pipelines should be built to automate this further
- renovate, zuul, ...
- Commercial offering around this makes sense (S7n/dNation/UhuruTec/syself)

### Cluster Stacks Refactor (@jschoone)

- Split Cluster Stacks [PR#203](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/203) in multiple smaller PRs for easier review
- Multi-stage addons in several phases `AfterControlPlanInitialized`, `BeforeClusterUpgrade`, `AfterClusterUpgrade`
  - based on [CAPI Lifecycle Hooks](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/tasks/experimental-features/runtime-sdk/implement-lifecycle-hooks)
  - Without listing addons in `BeforeClusterUpgrade`, they will be dropped -> bug or intention? (AI @jschoone: discuss with syself)

### Cleaning up clusters

- Loadbalancers prevent deletion
  - `BeforeClusterDelete` hook may help
  - Option: azimuth operator
- PVCs are not cleaned either
  - But don't block cluster deletion ...
  - May be intentional in special cases
