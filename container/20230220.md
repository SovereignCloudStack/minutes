## Agenda

### CAPI Images

* test new CAPI images based on Ubuntu 22.04 (https://github.com/osism/k8s-capi-images)
* @jschoone and @garloff discussed this last week
  * they ran into errors during testing
  * current assumption is: size is not the problem
  * network during testing does not come
  * Vexxhost also provides OpenStack K8s CAPI Images in ther magnum-cluster-api repository: https://github.com/vexxhost/magnum-cluster-api (Ubuntu 20.04 at the moment)
    * AI(berendt): ask Vexxhost if they want to share efforts on this topic
  * @matofeder and @chess-knight volunteered to take this task up and help with that
  * @berendt asks: is there a definite list of versions to be included in R4?
    * AI @jschoone: define which versions to include
  * there is no automatic CI for this present yet
    * release relevant to have automatic (aka: proper) CI

### Standardization work

#### Registry
* standards/#212: ADR Draft by dNation
  * comments have beed addressed
  * upstream PR https://github.com/goharbor/website/pull/421 (approved)
  * 2 open discussion  threads:
    * container registry use-cases
    * follow-up standard record for definition of "SCS compliance"?
      * discuss in SIG Standardization(?)
* k8s-harbor/#23: Investigation of Harbor deployment possibilities
  * upstream issue https://github.com/goharbor/harbor-operator/issues/1017 (helm dependency bug)
  * issue: helm chart vs. operator? -> AI: short ADR on this decision
* https://registry.scs.community
  * issue: Is Harbor deployed in HA mode (its storage layer as well)?
    * @joshmue, @matofeder, @garloff will take a meeting on this
      * AI's will follow from that meeting
  * issue: https://registry.scs.community/c/oidc/login -> 500 Internal Server Error 

* should we add "aaS" capabilities to the feature table?
  * keppel seems like a good way to provide multi tenancy
  * Harbor could be capable to do this (pointed out by @vad1mo (https://container-registry.com/)

#### IdP requirements (issues/#194)
* Team IAM needs some input from container team to understand requirements on IdP Broker
  * Who is experienced in that and can join Team IAM Meeting on wednesday 11:35 to 12:25 CET for a little workshop?
  * Where should the tenant segmentation take place?

#### OSS health checks
* Consider to automate SCS OSS Health checks defined in https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Drafts/OSS-Health.md 
  * Would be worth to investigate some automated tools? e.g. https://github.com/chaoss/augur 
    * Georg Link will do a Lightning talk related to this
