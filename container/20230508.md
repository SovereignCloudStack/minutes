### Housekeeping
#### New participants
* Jan Kummer, KDO: Works in R&D @KDO on k8s (Kommunale Datenzentrale Oldenburg)

#### Misc
* Public holiday in Slovakia (SK)

### k8s.gcr.io Redirect to registry.k8s.io
  - k8s.gcr.io [redirects to registry.k8s.io now](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/03/10/image-registry-redirect/), so the [repo patching in k8s-cluster-api-provider](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/blob/main/terraform/files/bin/fixup_k8sregistry.sh) should not be doing anything anymore
    - [k8s/#412](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/issues/412)
    - Goal: Cleanup and remove complexity again that was introduced to know which container images are where

### Standards

- Standardize additional storage classes [issues/#214](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/214)
    - has been discussed on [2023-02-13](https://input.scs.community/2023-scs-team-container#Storage) and [2023-01-09](https://input.scs.community/2023-scs-team-container#Sprint-review--Sprint-planning-httpsgithubcomorgsSovereignCloudStackprojects6views7)
    - Looks like a hot candidate is still RWX
    - Work on CephFS (for OpenStack Manila) in progress
        - could be a security issue as it's directly tied to tenant
        - investigate further the manila path
    - Investigate solutions in customer's k8s cluster (rook/ceph, longhorn or openebs)
    - Question: Should we really support that scenario as a standard opt-in feature as SCS? It has high complexity with high potential to break. Is it a legacy need that we should avoid?
        - ownCloud InfiniteScale discussion: File objects are on object storage (where they belong!), but the metadata is kept on RWX (instead of a database).
        - Maybe document how customers can do it on their own if they really need it (NetApp NFS servers or SW solutions like LongHorn helm charts)

### Feedback wanted
* Return on time invested: 1 (worst) ... 5 (best)
    * 4+5+3+3+3+4: 3.67 +- 0.82
