## :notebook: Agenda

### Deploy cluster-stacks management cluster using GitOps approach (@paulphys, @mxmxchere)

Current state: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/moin-cluster-config/

Achieved:
 - seperate scripts for "dev" and "prod" setups. A "dev" setup requires an external github_token and external clouds.yaml
 - The "prod" setup derives the github_token and the cloud credentials from secrets that are stored in the repository (encrypted). In addition to that external-dns, an ingress and some namespaces with cluster-stacks are deployed, so that they are ready to go. Also these namespaces are equipped with ClusterRoleBindings so that Users of the scs github-orga (in specific) teams can deploy clusters via oidc login.

PR for prod and dev: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/moin-cluster-config/pull/11
PR for RBAC: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/moin-cluster-config/pull/14

Improvements in dependency checks between the components (e.g. deploy cluster-api after cert-manager is ready):

### Sync cluster stack "scs" with "alpha" (@DEiselt, @mxmxchere)
PR:  https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/97

- v1beta1 API version of CAPO
- oidc
- remove obsolete "wooctavia" in some places

### Beginner's questions to SCS KaaS Certification (@fkr)

- I want to make my KaaS Offering SCS compliant. What do I have to do?
- Analogue to IaaS: Run compliance check suite as Action, resulting in pass or fail?
- Currently the certification scope is not fully completed
    - There are discussions in issues and partial tests
    - Current script for E2E testing: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/98c30f6aa6f0b741cb004a551f81f10d3b75fde8/Tests/scs-compatible-kaas.yaml
    - Relevant upstream discussion: https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/issues/2579
- What distros can be aligned to standards? Every k8s should work
- E2E tests PR with SCS compliance checks https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/53
- Martin will put the topic on next week's agenda to discuss further
    - https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-compatible-kaas/
