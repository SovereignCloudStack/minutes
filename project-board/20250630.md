	- AI @garloff to announce and invite
		- Need to find slots that work for @berendt and @garloff

#### Standardization decisions in teams
- Process, Procedural standards: Forum SCS-Standards can delegate power to SIG, veto
- Technical standards: Community driven. Project board delegates power to teams. Suggest to have SIG Std/Cert fill in for inactive teams: [PR Standards/#958](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/958)
	- Agreement
