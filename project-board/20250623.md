### Agenda

#### Open Redirect from monitoring.scs.community
- Mail about CVE-2025-4123 (grafana) forwarded from Alex Roger
- Severity for us?
- Fix?
	- Bumping grafana version is very likely enough
		- AI: @matofeder

#### Suitable place for technical blog articles going forward?
Options:

[scs.community/blog](https://scs.community/blog)
- Old site from SCS project, officially frozen ...

[sovereigncloudstack.org/news](https://sovereigncloudstack.org/news)
- New site, owned by Forum SCS-Standards
- Content not related to SCS-Standards might confuse standardization and reference implementation

[docs.scs.community](https://docs.scs.community/)
- Covers technical details for both standardization and ref.impl. today, so no *further* confusion
- Does not have blog articles yet
- Might want to move old ones over?
	- See if this can be done
	- Side discussion: Old web page needs to be deprecated more visibly

- Docusaurus blog plugin: https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog (Sample: https://docusaurus.io/blog)
- AI: @garloff to look into it
- Removal PR in osism.github.io: https://github.com/osism/osism.github.io/commit/6842d342f05e9ad27482194c8c3862c3cd228b3d
