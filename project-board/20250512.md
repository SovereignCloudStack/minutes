### Housekeeping

- @fkr will be AWOL on 19th (next week) - proposed to skip next week for all. @fkr will ping the matrix chat.

### Participants
- @matofeder
- @fkr
- @berendt
- excused: @jschoone

### Agenda

#### TOIs (Topics-of-Interests)  - @fkr

I'd like to propose, that each of us (Project board members) actually sees which Topic of interest (TOIs) are in his scope in order to push those forward / take care of during the rest of the tenure on the Project Board.

I for myself would see my area of focus to be the standardization (which would be a good match with the forum) as well as PR work for the overall community project.

- @matofeder likes the idea
- @berendt raises the point, that there is currently not so much needing to be taken care of regardless.
- @fkr starts a discussion about the overall (in)activity of the community. From @berendt's POV there is currently no need for further community building on the IaaS side. The IaaS / OSISM community is active and raising issues with @berendt and his team if need be. 
- @matofeder will see about finish his work on the stale repositories-work
