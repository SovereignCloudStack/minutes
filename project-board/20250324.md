#### Stale Repository Identifier (@matofeder)
- PR: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/github-manager/pull/331
    - based on procedural standard (draft) https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0006-v1-organization-management.md
    - Limitations
        - The action does not exclude auto-generated PRs (e.g., Renovate, Dependabot)
        - It does not handle repositories with no remaining codeowners as stale
- Report: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/github-manager/issues/332
- Suggestions
    - AI: @matofeder: Send eMail (scs-tech), informing about codeowners being used now, asking for volunteers to become codeowners (by submitting a PR with ther own name in codeowners)
        - expect low return ratio, then deal with it in project board
    - Do manual reviews twice a year (until we have automated the recognition of dependabot, renovate)
        - Jan 15, Jul 15 every year (send apptmt, @garloff)
        - @matofeder has some ideas how to automate this
        - Skip Jul 15, 2025 to weed out the unused ones before at least once
