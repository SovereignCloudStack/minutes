### Agenda
#### R9 aftermath, Release Notes
- R9 draft release notes: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/pull/32>
	- KaaS: Need to agree on naming (the hardest part!): Cluster Stack vs. Cluster Stack series
	- IaaS: Need input from @berendt
		- Did OSISM-10 even happen? Or do we have 9.4.0 with Epoxy? Or?
			- R10 happened, take input from <https://input.scs.community/Oiu8SCqoRguJSBZEwKOOHA#> (AI @berendt)
		- Testbed and CiaB status?
			- CiaB is working (on latest incl. Epoxy, capi disabled due to broken magnum connection, will be moved back to OSISM-10 after conclusion of University project)
			- Potentially allow extending CiaB into a mult-node system
		
- Next is R10? Or not?
	- OSISM is rather continuous (w.r.t. manager releases), major releases were for OpenStack mainly, customers tend to prefer yearly (SLURP) for those
		- Some divergence from customers desires for ceph, openstack, ...
		- Under discussion with customers
	- Visibility advantage (Press announcement, ...)
	- Software from SCS ecosystem supports the SCS standards message
