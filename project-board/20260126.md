### Agenda

#### scs.community

- @garloff checked: it is ok to turn off the old page
	- May allow us to disable mod_negotiation (we use it there for multi-language support)
	- ... although that is completely uncritical for us, security-wise
- @fkr will provide redirects

#### Mirroring

- Discussion on providing mirrors for bootstrapping systems
	- Avoiding flaky internet availability (current case: ansible galaxy)
- registry.scs.community runs on gx-scs2 (PS test env)
	- currently required by ClusterStacks
- Other services may be useful (think about [air gap scenario](https://sovereigncloudstack.org/community_blog/air-gapped-installation/))
	- Repo/Package mirror (aptly ...)
	- VM images (s3)
	- PyPI mirror
	- ansible ?
	- Container registry
- Need space/infra, policies and caretakers


#### Next scs.community

- @jschoone will facilitate
- One topic will be community registries, @jklare to prepare
