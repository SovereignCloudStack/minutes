### Housekeeping

#### AIs from last meeting

- @fkr: Invite for one overall meeting cwk8 (21.2.)
- @garloff: Group, ML for project board

### Agenda

#### Git Repo Management (@jschoone)
- Check Review/Merge process
- Enable protection of main branch for all repos -> @garloff
- Find inactive repos to archive
- Find inactive members
- Measuring inactivity thresholds: Document approach (as a standard) -> @matofeder
- Too lose control causes security concerns for some users, making them create downstream branches that we could avoid by having tighter control
- possible approach: CODEOWNERS files (per repository) & branch protection rules
  - https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners -> @jschoone
  - branch protection rules best managed in github-manager (to be confirmed) -> @garloff


#### Make our mailing-lists understandable and the almost perfect channel to reach the audiences (@fkr)
- We have three lists:
    - scs-member
    - scs-announce
    - scs-tech
- IÂ´d like to see (with Kurt's recent changes) that we clearly document what to expect on what and how to get on which in order to be sure that the proper audiences are reached (and the people we want to reach are also on the list we expect them to be on)
- Place: https://docs.scs.community/community/tools/mailinglists
- AI: @fkr and @garloff

#### Website (old and new) (@fkr)
  - I wrote a mail regarding the new webpage to the forum. The mail is also quoted in this issue: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/sovereigncloudstack.org/issues/20#issuecomment-2620905563
  - Kurt recently picked up quite a few tasks around the old webpage and we should make sure to support the work :)
  - The old webpage says: "There is a new web site with a refreshed branding which is maintained by the forum SCS-Standards together with the Community (via the SCS Project Board).", so I think, this is a good place to raise it now :)
- new website: https://www.sovereigncloudstack.org (https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/sovereigncloudstack.org)
- old website: https://scs.community/ (https://github.com/sovereigncloudstack/website)
- [docs](https://docs.scs.community/) stays as is
    - should this use the docs.sovereigncloudstack.org?
    - (and redirect from old domain)
- Putting content on sovereigncloudstack.org:
    - We should add blog posts ... -> @fkr
    - Section exists (currently only announcements, but we can add blogs)
- Non-ideal situation to have two web pages: confusing for newcomers
    - Maybe longterm hide the old one under a less prominent domain?
- SCS-conformance needs to be top and center for our SCS CSPs on our main page, may attract more CSPs -> @matofeder


#### SCS Hackathon in first half of this year (@fkr)

- From a mail I wrote to the forum regarding a Hackathon (@berendt suggested it a while ago in a forum's discussion about possible events in 2025): 

> Looking at the calendar, I wondered whether to have it in the week of
> April 7th to 11th or April 21st to April 25th.
> 
> Idea would be to:
> 
> -> Start at 1200 on Day 1, have some nice get together in the evening
> -> Go until 1300 on Day 2.
> 
> That way people would be able to travel there on Day 1 (if they don't want
> to come a day early) and be able to travel home on Day 2.

- Well, 7th to 11th April is vPTG. So not a good option.
- And the other week is directly after easter (raised by Marius)
- Apr 29+30? Erlangen?
    - @garloff, @jschoone, @matofeder and @fkr available
    - Idea is that the whole project board is present
    - pending check by @berendt
        - this has been checked: works for @berendt as well

#### Anything to prep for Domain-Manager Role discussion? (@fkr)
