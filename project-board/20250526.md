### Agenda
#### Cluster stacks release management
* Note: These topics may be discussed in the container call
	* Use [scs-training-kaas-scripts](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/scs-training-kaas-scripts) in Documentation (Quick-Start)?
	* Handle listing of available versions? [issue #224](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/issues/224)
	* Should have (at least) on CS release per K8s patch version, no?
		* Yes
			* Should be automated (renovate, just)
		* Release on github? On OCI?
			* github has the downside of requiring API-keys (to avoid rate-limits)
				* Discussion whether that is really as bad
				* Difference b/w releases and packages?
			* Two options
				* Only use OCI and delete (outdated!) releases from github
				* Or push at least all stable releases to github
			* Needs more investigation, github preferred for official versions IF we can avoid the rate-limit issue
		* Responsible?
	* [CSI helmchart fix](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/pull/2892) merged upstream
	* Use `clouds.yaml` instead of `cloud.conf` [PR #225](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/issues/225)
	* Default worker node volume [Issue #223](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/issues/223)

#### openDesk (S7n)
* Update openDesk install guide
	* Latest openDesk 1.3
	* Using syseleven designate plugin (rather then route53)

#### Last OSISM release
* OSISM R9 out
	* docs and release notes are out-of-date 
* Sidenote: CiaB still seems to be at OSISM-8.1.0 (aka SCS R7.1), not 9.0, with OpenStack 2024.1 and quincy
	* PRs welcome

#### Next OSISM release
* OSISM wants to do that before September, waiting for kolla-ansible to be ready

#### Admin rights for github org for volunteers?
* Marc Schoechlin (@scoopex) offered to assist with maintenance of github-manager and alike.

#### Info on Certification for Integrators
