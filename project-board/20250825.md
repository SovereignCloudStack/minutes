### Agenda

#### Is GitHub still a good fit for SCS? (@jschoone)
- moved to next week, when all people are present

#### Start making use of the SCS Hardware Lab (@fkr)
- more an fyi item that @fkr wants to make sure that the colleagues from B1 now onboard us and others from the community as users onto the lab

#### Two clusters on wavestack mostly repaired (@garloff)
- K8s-1.29.3 without updates for a year, certs had expired
	- Had to repair by
		- Booting rescue image to inject a password
		- `kubeadm certs renew all`
		- Copying out new cluster-admin client certs
		- Removing `certmgr/cert-manager-webhook-ca` secret (gets regenerated)
		- Additional complication by broken gateway, too low instance quota, lost root volume (infra issues, all have been addressed by wavecon over time)
- `mgmt` cluster
	- Services:
		- capi mgmt for zuul cluster
		- keycloak
		- DependencyTrack
		- DefectDojo
			- Currently down (insufficient resoures)
	- Lacking one worker node
	- Parent capi-mgmt cluster gone
- `zuul` cluster
	- Service: zuul
	- Had to feed new credentials to openbao (vault) so it can create clusters and VMs again
	- Working again: 
		- Compliance checks working
	- Not yet:
		- security-infra-scan-pipeline
			- need to look at defectdojo issue
		- k8s-cluster-api-provider
			- need to adjust job for gx-scs2
	- Parent capi-mgmt cluster: `mgmt`
- Long-term approach:
	- Start using zuul (and defectdojo and dependencytrack) more intensely or drop those clusters
		- Would need to run compliance checks differently then (cron jobs, gh actions, ...)
	- Require more than one individual caring if we want to continue with zuul (and the clusters where it's hosted)
