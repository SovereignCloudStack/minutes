### Housekeeping

- no PB upcoming monday due to public holiday in Germany

### Participants

- @fkr
- @garloff

### Topics
- Marvin starts today as Std/Cert/Test Engineer w/ OSBA
- SCS-compatible IaaS would better be named SCS-compatible OpenStack (as we mandate OpenStack APIs)
	* Would leave space for a "SCS-compatible IaaS" that does not mandate OpenStack APIs
		- Would be a meta-standard then
		- Should define what services with what features are being delivered (whatever the names and APIs)
