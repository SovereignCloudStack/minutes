### Agenda

#### SCS Project Board submission to the SCS summit (@garloff)
- Drafted [here](https://input.scs.community/fMT3lIauTZ-6hi6ahKWREw?both#) based on [this input](https://input.scs.community/fMT3lIauTZ-6hi6ahKWREw?both#)
- Already communicated to Lisa, incl. our flexibility to do EN or DE language and to change the number of presenters based on the length of the slot
	- @garloff's preference would be EN language and a slot that allows the four of us

#### Repairing zuul and mgmt clusters (@garloff)
- Certificate expired due to lack of upgrades for one year(!)
	- Instance quota too low (in sponsored env by Wavecon), killed one worker node to repair ...
		- Request to increase quota has been submitted
	- Repaired with resuce image and `kubeadm certs renew` plus a few more steps for `mgmt` cluster
	- [More details](https://input.scs.community/2025-scs-team-opsseciam#)
- Found issue with `external` gateways on wavestack
	- reported
- `zuul` cluster control plane node fails to reboot into rescue image (and back with unrescue)
	- waiting or help from wavecon
	- moderately pessimistic
- Discussion:
	- Is it worth running our own zuul instance?
		- Could use OpenInfra?
		- github actions?
		- Does not require much, cronjob would do as well, period job in k8s SCS cluster stack
	- Just for compliance checks, zuul is overkill
		- Identify additional intended usage
			- Drop it if none is found
			- After we have a suitable replacement

#### Sovereign Tech Fund (STF @ STA) proposal (@garloff)
- Still need to write things down
	- Trustable image building will be part of it (~3FTE)
		- Infrastructure cost will not be insignificant
			- MVP (until the end of the year) can be more modest
			- scaleup SCS env could be used (with Forum's approval)
		- Person investment will also be about networking, community building, getting traction, ...
			- Curation
		- Technical work: Build process, SBOMs, Security analysis, QA, CI, notrary, cosign, [reproducible-builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/), [OBS](https://openbuildservice.org/), ...
			- Outlandish thoughts: Capture pypi, ...
	- Status page++, Monitor++, Billing++
	    - berendt: Billing >= Monitor > Status
	- What else?
- Needs ideas on staffing ...
