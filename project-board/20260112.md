- @garloff volunteers and everyone in the round likes this.

#### What about admin@

    - @fkr
    - rotate going forward
- Possible topics?
    - Enclaive would like to give an intro to their view on confidential containers and why it would be worthwhile to standardize this. Maybe 15 Minutes for this topic?
        - Yes, let's do it
        - This should become a general option to have speed talks this way

- Please register
- Focus topic: KaaS
- https://input.scs.community/NQ_hwTLkTmKXwbJlz3T-mw


#### Archival of https://scs.community/

- sponsor: @fkr
- TL;DR: the old page (https://scs.community) causes confusion and we elaborated in the past, that the relevant content (blog posts, Announcements, news items) should be moved to an archive section on the new page (https://sovereigncloudstack.org). 
- The content has been added: https://sovereigncloudstack.org/en/community-news/ - this is linked from the main page through the 'Insights'
- I would like to propose that with this being present, wo go ahead and turn of the old page and redirect visitors going to https://scs.community directly via a moved permamently (#301) to the new page.
    - Individual redirects for DeepLinks?
        - Should be created automatically, but let's not wait for it (@mbayr, @fkr)

#### Goals

##### Technology development

- Identifying gaps
- Aligning community members to fill them in a joint, official project

##### SCS as a product

- Releases?
- "Reference implementations"
	- Define? Drop?
	- One per area? Several?
- Security updates and Security advisories?

##### Standardization

- KaaS-v1 is really needed badly!
    - ... and more (Database, Queuing, ...)
- Differentiate between best practices (and establish good exchange) and standards (which should be more abstract / higher level)
    - *Needs stronger alignment with and more feedback from customers/users!*

##### Driving community engagement

- Open vs non-open PrjB
- Driving team meets
