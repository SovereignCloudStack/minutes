### Agenda

#### HW-Lab

sponsor: @fkr

- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/341
- Please review!

#### DPG <> SCS Standards

sponsor: @garloff & @fkr

- https://matrix.to/#/!PUAoumjlJAdxrAqFNm:matrix.org/$NnHVqsWUta6wpAdGLAmDDy5uzdyzOqq2TGw5GtQqHrk?via=matrix.org&via=regio.chat&via=matrix.uhurutec.com
- Tools: https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/toolkit
- Some OSS projects have been doing this
- Would provide us some visibility -- seems to be a good fit
- AI @fkr to further investigate
- Understand how people will not get buried in thousands of DPGs ...

#### Massively scalable architecture discussion w/ NeoNephos / Vasu

sponsor: @garloff & @fkr

Discussion at OSPS @garloff, @fkr, Vasu Chandrasekhara (moving from SAP to NeoNephos)
- Different vision of highly scalable infra (∞ra, apeiora)
	- Scalable Fabric (SONiC plus legacy)
	- BM provisioning (see IronCore)
	- K8s/kcp control plane aka "undercloud"
	- Use this to provision user-facing k8s clusters (gardener, capi, ...)
	- Use this also to provide OpenStack (CobaltCore, k-orc)
- SCS standards (and ecosys software) could have a role there
- Platform mesh abstracts technical APIs to provision infra to have multi-region business contracts

ToDo: Decide on the best way to follow up.

Potential (1d?) workshop:
- See where this fits together with SCS goals, architecture, software, standards
- See how this may inspire further direction of SCS development

#### Random FOSDEM input
- https://devguard.opencode.de is pretty cool, watch videos

#### Team IaaS meet
- regular meeting not established again, support (to-be-founded) OSISM and yaook community meets, schedule common meet only on demand
