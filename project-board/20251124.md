### Agenda


#### How to proceed with zuul
- complex beast
- more than we need for the compliance checks
- is maintained, but minimally so, needs either more invest to be on the safe side or stop using it medium-term
	- where to run the jobs in the future?
		- openCode would have sufficient capabilities for us
- Side discussion: Moving repos ...
	- Standards, cluster stacks, ... could all be treated separately
	- Running compliance checks is not dependent on where the standards repos live
- Plan: Test whether compliance jobs can be moved (AI @depressiveRobot)
- Old copy from github on openCode should be removed (as it's outdated)

#### R9 [release notes](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/pull/32)
- final wording w.r.t. cluster stack *series* or not (today) 
- OSISM pieces still missing (AI @berendt, Mon/Tue next week)

#### Project Board Elections
- @fkr will now start the nomination process
- skip the election if no single community member objects (in private to @fkr) and the complete board wants to continue
	- AI @fkr: PR against SCS-0005 and mail asking for vetos
	- Elected board members want to continue
	- Invite people to become more engaged with or without election
