### Agenda

#### Security announcements for the reference implementations / software from the SCS Ecosystem

sponsor: @fkr

- Security Advisories have been prepared in the past
	- Helpful
- The keystonemiddleware thing did fortunately not hit the default configuration of most clouds (OSISM, yaook)
- Do we want to still publish this advisory?
	- Linking yaook and OSISM advisories
- How do we want to handle this in the future?
- We want, but can we?
	- Need commitments from partners that deliver ref.impl. pieces
- Delivery process for advisories
	- What's broken, patches need to come from OSS projects
	- Product integration company needs to create patch mechanism / instructions / updates for the product components
	- Proposal
		- SCS project does not have product responsibility
		- But helpful links to others
		- Ticker
	- Alternative proposal
		- SCS commits to create advisories for high-risk issues
		- Linking to software partners
			- As they are ready, let's not wait for them
	- Do this, need to create Blog space on docs.scs.community
		- Security issue is implementation (product, tech stack) specific
