    - Clarify in the "About SCS" section
        - Have a section for review on this early (AI @friederikezelke)
    - But focus on talking about R8 (as released by SCS Community)

###### Highlights OSISM / IaaS

###### Highlights Tooling
- New release for container registry

#### SCS Monitoring (@matofeder)
- Redeployment rather than migration
- Initial deployment/config is done https://monitoring.scs.community
    - Observes monitoring cluster and several SCS https endpoints
    - Matrix chat alerting works
    - TODOs:
        - Google OAUTH
        - Add more services e.g. harbor cluster
- Try to get everything into a stable green state, so any alerts should be observed again
    - Start to treat it this way once @matofeder has all fixes in

#### keycloak on UCS still does not have a cert signed by a well-known CA (AI @garloff)
