	    - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/1037

#### Cleanup of GitHub repositories

* Felix and Christian prepared a PR to archive some inactive repositories: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/github-manager/pull/353
    * check if you want to add/remove repositories
	* Process followed by @berendt
		- not following precisely the 1yr inactivity
		- using judgement: inactive and no expectation that they will become active again soon
		- two repos related to Gaia-X are unclear
		    - gx-credential-generator
		    - scs-did-creator
		- we should also add CODEOWNERS on active repos
			- by the latest on [migrating to opencode](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/codeowners/)
* Should double-check the PR
* Let's do the cleanup this year!
	* One can always un-archive things
