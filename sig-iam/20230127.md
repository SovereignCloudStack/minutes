## Topics:
* Zitadel PoC
* ADR for IdP (really just OIDC, Dev Authz Grant, .. what else?)
* @jnull: The important question is the connection to the customer
* The current vision of Wavecon is
  * to have a separate page for the IAM related onboarding and user & rights management
  * The onboarding service (backend service, HTTP REST) then provisions stuff into Zitadel
  * Zitadel is then the single source of truth from there on
  * In Zitadel Roles & Clients etc are provisioned in a template project for each customer organization and those objects can be "inherited" (or used) in other projects. The customer cannot "shoot himself in the foot" that way.
  * A Reconciliation Loop (also written in go?) runs periodically to provision stuff in
    * Gardner
    * OpenStack
  * There are customers that only want CaaS and not IaaS
  * The assignment of roles in OpenStack/Keystone shall be as non-invasive with respect to adjusting policies as possible. Extending polices excessively would slow down policy evaluation in all OpenStack services
  * OSISM TMon (?) is envisioned to be a possible technical component for the reconciliation loop.
