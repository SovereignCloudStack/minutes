### Userstories for Epic #191

### Technical Prerequisites [Issue 210](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/210)

* 1. We need to "whack" the testbed into shape so that we can to OIDC authentication with openstack cli at all (So just be able to do `openstack --v3oidcpassword` against Keycloak and then be able to use Keystone, without the "Identity Federation" to some external IdP realm)
* 2. Setup Keycloak federation in testbed-iam.cloudctl.io

### Actual hacking

* Research into [keystoneauth source code]() to find out if openstack --v3oidcpassword is the right way to go to achieve OIDC Identity Federation [Issue 209](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/209)
* IF keystoneauth is only providing v3oidcpassword, i.e. "Resource Owner Grant" as an OIDC Auth Flow, then either: 1. Research how we can extend keystoneauth/openstack-cli to support "Authorization Code Grant". Or, alternativenly , extend Keycloak to support "Identity Federation" for the "Resource Owner Grant" Flow (which is called "Direct Grant" in Keycloak.
