### OpenStack Domain level administration and policies

API gateway (request router), key feature: Protect APIs, e.g. by request throtteling

Currently we would need the roles pre-defined on a "terrible granular level"

Matthias: Extensive policies will probably slow down API calls
Artem: Application Credentials may help, look like an interesting concept -> which APIs are allowed for which Node. Maybe interesting, but no practical experience, experiments required
There are huge differences (and detailed ones) between openstack deployments
Artem: Keystone docs say (in a section about "policy deprecation"): "Keystone is not a policy management service, please don't use it for that"
Mathias: Ok, we need to strive for a separation of catalogue and policy generation

### OpenStack CLI auth and Federation

delegated authZ to "Keystone auth Library"
Methods: https://opendev.org/openstack/keystoneauth/src/branch/master/keystoneauth1/identity/v3
And that hands down to Keystone
MFA with CLI would be a usage nightmare for users and it would not be usable in ansible (so not for machine to machine), but adding support for yubikeys to openstack CLI would be cool/useful (just like it's possible for SSH [see e.g.](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide) )
