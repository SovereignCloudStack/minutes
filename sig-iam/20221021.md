### Items

* debrief TC
  * tl;dr for product board
* finish epics
* identify next items

* Arvid
    *  Priority Option 1) CLI/API and Weblogin via federated Identity (Issue #191)
        *  1.1 Get openstack-cli working Keystone to Keycloak working again in hte testbed (i.e. without "identity brokering")
            * Testbed setup with multiple Keycloaks (Issue #95?)
                * Certificates need to work, the current Let's encrypt workaround will break in about 2 weeks
        * Get openstack-cli work with "Identity brokering"
    *  Priority Option 2) Work on the policy/role extension for "Domain Administrator" separation
* Jeff:
    * Policies are the most important (but maybe that is out of scope in R3)
    * Define what is an acceptable realistic feature set? So, I kind of "Definition of Done"
    * Do we need a separate service to make the "Domain Administrator" separation working
    * Wants to see in a PoC if citadel better fits the bill better than keycloak
    * 
Matthias:
    * Work on the policy layer, define new personas like what upstream wants to do with "Manager" in the long term
    * Go one service at a time (using the "scope feature" of Keystone), limit to swift, nova, neutron
    *
