# Team IaaS

Rebort by @matofeder

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

----

# Team IaaS

**Greenfield Rook Deployment**
- IaaS already supports Rook Operator deployment 
- Ongoing: Rook CephCluster deployment
    - Ready for testing & review [PR#411](https://github.com/osism/ansible-playbooks/pull/411), [PR#1427](https://github.com/osism/ansible-collection-services/pull/1427), [PR#588](https://github.com/osism/osism.github.io/pull/588) 
- Backlog: RADOS Gateway for Keystone and Swift integration [#1027](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/1027)

----

# Team IaaS

**VM migration**
- [hystax](https://hystax.com/cloud-migration/); [cloudbase/coriolis](https://github.com/cloudbase/coriolis)
- license needed in both, the topic needs further discussion

---

# Team IaaS

**VPNaaS based on OVN**
- Is enabled upstream (ovn-vpn agent) in 2024.1 Caracal (but not yet in kolla-ansible)
- Available in SCS R7? -> an issue (request) would need to be created

---


# Team IAM & Security - IAM

The Team IAM deals with topics around Identity and Access Management.

Sovereign Cloud Stack has the goal that user identities can used across several layers in the stack (most importantly IaaS and Container layer), that user management should be a self-service capability and that user identities can be federated.

Authentication and Authorization are important topics for the security of a platform. We deal with those here, but currently also the broader topics around security / penetration testing.

----

# Team IAM & Security - IAM / Security

* Role Standard
    * Positive feedback from upstream

----

# Team IAM & Security - IAM / Security
 
* Couple MR regarding example setup in testbed and **docs**
* MR documenting how to build new Keycloak images
* Starting to work on the CA cert import issue

----

# Team IAM & Security - IAM / Security
 
* Federation Keystone - Keycloak 
    * Necessity of a driver (e.g. like VexxHost)
* Roles should be moved out of keycloak as keycloak doesn't know about resources (projects, domains, clusters ...)

----

# Team IAM & Security - IAM / Security

* Security pipelines failures in zuul fixed
* Greenbone blockers solved
    * Doc improvement contribution
* Working in making Trivy work on a pipeline
