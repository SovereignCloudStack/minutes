# SCS Tech Weekly 2022-09-29

## Meta

- Minutes: Jonas

**Note**: There will be no team call on 2022-11-10 because of the OSBA general assembly and networking day.

## Team Updates

### Team IaaS

Minutes not available yet: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/minutes/tree/main/iaas/

(Jonas was late and unable to record this)

### Team Container

Minutes not available yet: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/minutes/tree/main/container/

- Discussed container layer architecture in overflow slot

  - Different use cases: self-service end-user approach, internal self-service, internal self-service for providing managed clusters ..

### Team Operations and IAM

Minutes not available yet: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/minutes/tree/main/ops-iam/

- No major topics, steady progress
- Own domain for larger customers, to allow federation and things

  - The roles in OpenStack do not yet fully allow that, abstraction-wise

### IAM SIG

- Work on the testbed

### Monitoring SIG

- Discussed container observability

  - Identified gap: we have to be able to monitor the k8s api at least, but we cannot do that without having control plane separate from the cluster

### Community SIG

### Standardisation SIG

- The observable standards haven't been implemented yet (image metadata etc.)
- For images, it makes sense as the openstack-image-manager doesn't support that yet
- Worked on the documentation process for standards

### Open Operations Manifesto WG

- Deployed the logo and worked on the texts

### Open hacking session

### Next overflow slot

## AOB

## Project Updates

**NB:** This section will only contain the minutes on things which are not explicitly mentioned in the corresponding slides. In addition, things which are being repeated (such as job offers) in meetings will may not be repeated in the minutes.

### Release management

- Looked into the OpenSSL vulnerability impact

  - Prepared for catastrophic impact, but that luckily didn't happen
  - Impact on SCS is low in general because we have only internal services using Ubuntu 22.04
  - Still published the advisory on tuesday

### Community

- Save the date: Community summit on May 23rd--24th in Berlin
- Cemil and Katharina will talk about SCS and Open Operations at the DATEV DigiCamp
