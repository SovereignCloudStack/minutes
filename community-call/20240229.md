# Welcome ... 

Any newcomers?

# Towards R6

* R6 is scheduled for 2024-03-20
* Release candidate schedule published: [Blog post](https://scs.community/2024/02/01/road-ro-r6/)
    * RC0 seems to have gotten only testbed & CiaB coverage
    * RC1 done last week
        - Some findings (mostly addressed already)
        - Test, Test, Test
    * RC2 scheduled Mar 6
* Matrix room [SCS | RelEng & Testing R6](https://matrix.to/#/#scs-r6-releng:matrix.org)

# Updates from the Teams

---

# Team IaaS

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

----

# Team IaaS

* Testing of RC1
    -  plan your testing:  https://scs.community/2024/02/01/road-ro-r6/
* New deployment and day-2-ops tooling software defined storage (ceph)

----

# Team IaaS

* Communication with Tellus project for cloud interconnectivity: organized internal meeting to discuss Tellus and SCS alignment further
* Аccess received on Plusserver for VP04, creating a testbed
* Threat Model for VP04 with Mitm-attack scenario: ongoing
* Researching VP04/Lot2a - Encryption between user workloads (VXLAN/Geneve)

---

# Team IAM & Security

----

# Security & pentest

* Building the Sectest pipeline (ProjectDiscovery Tools; naabu, httpx, nuclei)
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/
    * Done on own zuul, will move to SCS zuul soon
    * Working on resolving waits in ansible
    * 10-15min cycle time
* Next: Add Greenbone, ZAP
* Advisories summarized & uploaded

----

# Keycloak deployment on control plane

* Need CA certs in Java keystore for logout(!)
    * Running keytool as root won't work in k8s container
    * Cert is there, find rootless way to put it at the right place
* Trouble with missing env variables
    * works after retrying, needs reproduction & analysis
* Identity-only testbed deployment:
    * Missing `octavia_member` role
    * Might need a few tweaks for identity-only deployments to make mappings and horizon happy

----

# Keystone - federation

* Federated users may have outdated roles in database
* Moving roles into tokens (just like group memberships)?
* Trouble is that we need to get properly project- (or domain-) scoped tokens from unscoped login token
    * Have all roles in unscoped token and transport back- and forth for scoped tokens?
    * Or use database, but only as cache to be dropped upon token expiration and re-login?
* Upstream discussions pending

---

# Team Ops

We build tooling and infrastructure design for easy, efficient 
and transparent ways to operate an SCS Cloud.

----

# Team Ops

- **Zuul:** gx-scs branch was merged into main, docs follow.. 
    - Data persistence of Zuul instances still WIP - ZooKeeper + MySQL
- **Status Page:** current work regarding incident details page and table view
    - Issue with `ImpactType` not yet resolved due to collegue absence
- **Central API:** discussion about compatibility to backends, especially Gardener
    - Reviews of "design considerations and reasoning" in [central-api/pull/4](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/central-api/pull/4) needed!

---

# Team Container

----

# Team Container

**Tests for recently stabilized standards**

- Kubernetes Node Distribution and Availability - [scs-0214-v1](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0214-v1-k8s-node-distribution)
- Kubernetes version policy - [scs-0210-v2](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0210-v2-k8s-version-policy)

----

# Team Container

**Kubernetes Node Distribution and Availability**

- topology.kubernetes.io/region
- topology.kubernetes.io/zone
- kubernetes.io/hostname <-- the hostname is not the hostname of the hypervisor, but just of the K8s node

----

# Team Container

**Kubernetes version policy**

- Currently K8s versions 1.27, 1.28, 1.29 - have to be kept up to date
    - The test script expects one cluster per Kubernetes (minor) version and then checks whether it's up-to-date
    - There is interest from KaaS providers (such as Syself and REGIO) to be SCS compliant
    - SCS will include conformance tests as a tasks into the existing e2e test job (KaaS v1) on Zuul

----

# Team Container

**RC1 - KaaS V2**

- **Test it!**: [Quickstart Guide](https://input.scs.community/_HeOTRCRSu2Uf2SfMSoOkQ)
    - RC1 needs more testing!
    - Quickstart Quide has been simplified (ClusterResourceSet to get secret into workload clusters)
