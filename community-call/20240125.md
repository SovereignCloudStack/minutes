# Welcome ... 

Any newcomers?

---

# Updates from the Teams

---

# Team IaaS

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

----

# Team IaaS

* meeting with the Tellus project is being arranged in the next time to disuss the cloud interconnectivity topic
* further dicussions on the future deployment of Ceph (requirements, blockers, migration, missing features, ..)
    * we need more input from operators: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/515 

----

# Team IaaS

* further discussion on encryption in Kubernetes clusters
* BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) not yet possible with barbican, will be presented at the next Barbican meeting
    * https://meetings.opendev.org/#Barbican_Meeting

----

# Team IaaS

* if you operate a public cloud please join the OpenDev Public Cloud SIG
    *  https://meetings.opendev.org/#Public_Cloud_SIG_Meeting

---

# Team IAM

The Team IAM deals with topics around Identity and Access Management.

Users that access cloud and container infrastructure need to authenticate themselves and then authorizations to see and access resources from the infrastructure are derived from the identity of the users as they belong to groups and roles are assigned to them (or the groups they belong to). SCS wants users to be managed across layers of the stack and across providers to allow for federation.

Authentication and Authorization are important topics for the security of a platform. We deal with those here, but currently also the broader topics around security / penetration testing. (Findings may need to be discussed and addressed in other teams.)

----

# Team IAM/Sec
* Draft of Automated Pentest Methodology uploaded to NextCloud
* IaaS pentest: identified issues on Manager and Nodes
    * Initial test were done without Hardening
    * Repeat the test with hardening and compare

----

# Team IAM/Roles
* No news regarding roles

----

# Team IAM/Federation
* Keystone upstream patch regarding mapping federated users to domains
    * Positives votes, near merge
    * New subsequent issue: Assign domain specific roles to users
* Roles assigned only on first login
    * Document this for the time being
    * Behavior will be changed upstream

----

# Team IAM/Keycloak-deployment
* Keycloak deployment on control plane k3s
    * PoC done
    * Working on automation, helm charts,...
* Automate Container Image Build and push
    * MR waiting 

---

# Team Ops

# SIG Community

Was canceled this week (due to team members being unavailable)

----

## Community Member Pages

* The ability to communicate, share and discuss is an important factor to be successful as a community.`
* Therefore we decided in [SIG Community](https://input.scs.community/2023-scs-sig-community#Improvement-Add-a-directory-of-employees-and-community-members) to publish the
  * [SCS Employees](https://scs.community/de/employees/)
    (Reachable by `Discover SCS` -> `Employees`)
  * [Community Members](https://scs.community/de/members/)
    (Not linked on the website at the moment, but maybe in the future.)

----

## Contribute to the Community Member Pages

* We would be very happy if you also share your profiles.
* This not only improves our communication possibilities, but also shows the outside world that we are a vital and serious community.
* Just raise a pull request, as Eduard described that with his [blog article](https://scs.community/2023/01/27/community-profiles/)
* Contact [Marc](https://scs.community/de/schoechlin) and [Friederike](https://scs.community/de/zelke) for technical and structural issues

# Hacking sessions: 
* 2024-02-09 13:05 - 14:55 CET: Hacking Session to get real community pages with all needed information - you are all heartily invited, the more input we get the better! - Improvement of the community pages: first draft here: https://input.scs.community/2023-sig-community-section#

# SCS Tenders

* VP12 (Health Mon): Waiting for official release of €€€
* VP09b-2 (Supply Chain Security): Will be published again shortly. (First round did not yield acceptable offer.)
* VPXX - A new order is currently being prepared: Database as a Service.

---

# Open Door Sessions (Reminder)

* Beginning in January felix will offer a weekly open door session
* This session is dedicated to Operators (even weeks) and Integrators (odd weeks) in order to facilitate various product feedback
* Thursdays 12:05 CET/CEST

---

# Towards R6

* R6 is scheduled for 2024-03-20
* First release candidates in early February
* We encourage lots of testing (especially with CSPs)
* Keep in mind we take our users seriously
    * Technology changes need to be communicated
    * Upgrade paths need be implemented, tested, documented
      (or old technology be maintained forever)
* Larger changes should be finalized and basically work before first RC (to ensure testing is meaningful)
* [zuul CI system](https://zuul.scs.community/) gets significant love
    * keep it green all the time, so it's useful
    * additional test cases wanted
    * ask Roy and Oliver (both @gonicus) for help
