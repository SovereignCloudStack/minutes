# Welcome ... 

We have a newcomer in our team!

---

# Updates from the Teams

---

# Team IaaS

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

----

# Team IaaS

* [ADR PR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/440) for SONiC support in SCS
    * SDN including scalability support
    * Recommendation to use either Community or Enterprise edition
* SDS questionnaire to cloud providers and/or customers
    * [Feedback requested](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/515#issuecomment-1884433174) for Ceph based deployment behavior and day to day use
* Various OSISM improvements during holiday season

---

# Team IAM

The Team IAM deals with topics around Identity and Access Management.

Users that access cloud and container infrastructure need to authenticate themselves and then authorizations to see and access resources from the infrastructure are derived from the identity of the users as they belong to groups and roles are assigned to them (or the groups they belong to). SCS wants users to be managed across layers of the stack and across providers to allow for federation.

Authentication and Authorization are important topics for the security of a platform. We deal with those here, but currently also the broader topics around security / penetration testing. (Findings may need to be discussed and addressed in other teams.)

----

# Team IAM/Sec

* [Blog Post on Intel reptar & AMD cachewrap issues](https://scs.community/2024/01/03/intel-amd-cpu-vulns/)
* Testbed assessment with low privileged user/role [#494](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/)
* No response about OpenSearch vuln from maintainers.

----

# Team IAM/Roles

* Handover from Markus to Josephine

----

# Team IAM/IAM

* Technical planning for Keycloak on k3s with CloundNativePG backend
* Upstream work on Keystone mapping of ephemeral/federated users to customer domain

---

# Team Ops

We build tooling and infrastructure design for easy, efficient and transparent ways to operate an SCS Cloud.

----

# Team Ops

* Introduction of new PO and new Gonicus colleague
* Discussed next steps to increase Observability of Zuul
* presentation of the current HTML Prototype of the Status Page frontend
    * Features colorblind mode and accessible tables for motorically restricted people

# SIG Community

We come together to shape our community strategy and coordinate collaborative efforts within our community.


----

## Community Member Pages

* The ability to communicate, share and discuss is an important factor to be successful as a community.`
* Therefore we decided in [SIG Community](https://input.scs.community/2023-scs-sig-community#Improvement-Add-a-directory-of-employees-and-community-members) to publish the
  * [SCS Employees](https://scs.community/de/employees/)
    (Reachable by `Discover SCS` -> `Employees`)
  * [Community Members](https://scs.community/de/members/)
    (Not linked on the website at the moment, but maybe in the future.)

----

## Contribute to the Community Member Pages

* We would be very happy if you also share your profiles.
* This not only improves our communication possibilities, but also shows the outside world that we are a vital and serious community.
* Just raise a pull request, as Eduard described that with his [blog article](https://scs.community/2023/01/27/community-profiles/)
* Contact [Marc](https://scs.community/de/schoechlin) and [Friederike](https://scs.community/de/zelke) for technical and structural issues
