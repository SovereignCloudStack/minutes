# Team IAM & Security

The Team IAM deals with topics around Identity and Access Management.

Users that access cloud and container infrastructure need to authenticate themselves and then authorizations to see and access resources from the infrastructure are derived from the identity of the users as they belong to groups and roles are assigned to them (or the groups they belong to). SCS wants users to be managed across layers of the stack and across providers to allow for federation.

Authentication and Authorization are important topics for the security of a platform. We deal with those here, but currently also the broader topics around security / penetration testing. (Findings may need to be discussed and addressed in other teams.)

----

# Team IAM/Roles
* Aligning with upstream "consistent RBAC" initiative
* Following upstream for Domain-Manager discussions, pending patches

----

# Team IAM/Federation
* Keystone upstream patch regarding mapping federated users to domains
    * One patch got merged
    * Subsequent issue: Assign domain specific roles to users is in discussion
* Need to determine how upstream patch can trickle back to us (without waiting for 1 year)
    * Upstream backports
    * OSISM integration
* Roles assigned only on first login
    * Document this for the time being
    * Behavior will be changed upstream

----

# Team IAM/Keycloak-deployment
* Keycloak deployment on control plane k3s PoC done
* Open: How to best inject helm charts, where to retrieve parameters (domain name, certs, ...)
    * Get into testbed for testing
    * Get into ansible-collection-services
    * Goal: Make RC0
* Automate Container Image Build and push
    * Workflow still failing despite fixing secrets

----

# Team IAM/Sec
* Testbed (Manager & Nodes) findings still under assessment
* Automated Pentest Methodology aligned
    * Trigger dynamic security testing tools from pipelines
    * Containerize all scanning tools
    * Trigger scans and collect results on scan server
    * Most focus on nightly pipeline
* Testbed challenge
    * Playbook deployed VM did not have working networking, worked around by manual creation -> report issue

# SIG Documentation

![](https://input.scs.community/uploads/d5e02cde-7e4a-4c6c-9474-7e33e3564a5c.png =50%x50%)
Current W.I.P. State:
https://docs-staging.scs.community/docs

- Aim: Improve overview of SCS on different levels
- One visual component that is context-aware of the whole stack  and individual index pages
- Gives greater context of the project and its components via 1) tree view and 2) visualistion
- Currently only the components which are part of scs docs
