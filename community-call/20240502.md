# Any newcomers? Welcome!

# Updates from the Teams

---

# Team IaaS

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

----

# Team IaaS

- No call this week due to holidays
- Minor OSISM release 7.0.3 planned for tomorrow

---

# Team IAM & Security - IAM

The Team IAM deals with topics around Identity and Access Management.

Sovereign Cloud Stack has the goal that user identities can used across several layers in the stack (most importantly IaaS and Container layer), that user management should be a self-service capability and that user identities can be federated.

Authentication and Authorization are important topics for the security of a platform. We deal with those here, but currently also the broader topics around security / penetration testing.

----

# Team IAM & Security - IAM / Security

- No call this week due to holidays
- Team changes on Univention side

# Team Ops

Report by @matofeder

We build tooling and infrastructure design for easy, efficient 
and transparent ways to operate an SCS Cloud.

----

# Team Ops 

* **Status Page** 
    * Blog Article `SCS Status Page - Technical Preview Released` available: https://scs.community/tech/2024/04/30/status-page-tech-preview-release/ 

----

# Team Ops 

* **IaaS Monitoring**
    * SCS observability solution inside OSISM K3s management cluster
        * One major known issue has been fixed: Monitoring of K3s control plane components
        * Try it: `$ osism apply kubernetes-monitoring`
    * SCS observability solution inside SCS Landscape
        * Contribute: Brainstorming [PAD](https://input.scs.community/IHjU5U2cTzaNHEx5k5nz5Q#)

# Team Container

Report by @jschoone

We're building a streamlined platform that simplifies the management of Kubernetes clusters on various providers.

----

# Team Container
## Standards

Standard "K8s cluster baseline security" rewritten and now titled "K8s cluster hardening"

----

# Team Container
## Progress on improving Cluster Stacks
- kube-apiserver certSANs now configurable, next will be oidc config
- Currently different Cluster Stacks with almost same config will be merged to one for simplicity

----

# Team Container
## Support for additional providers
- Metal³ and Kamaji lacked on ClusterClass support
    - addressed upstream and supported soon

----

# Team Container
## Request for a productive cluster
- idea of dogfooding revived
- depends on oidc-config
- can be created as workload cluster from the moin cluster

----

# Team Container
## Moin Cluster
- what's that?
    - will do a lightning talk on it and on its idea

---
