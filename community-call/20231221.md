# Welcome ... 

Any newcomers?

Feel invited to introduce yourselves!

---

# Updates from the Teams

---

# Team IaaS

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

----

# Team IaaS

* [SONiC discussion](https://input.scs.community/SCS-DR-SONIC-usage?both#SCS-Decision-Record-about-Enterprise-vs-Custom-SONiC)

---

# Team IAM

The Team IAM deals with topics around Identity and Access Management.

Users that access cloud and container infrastructure need to authenticate themselves and then authorizations to see and access resources from the infrastructure are derived from the identity of the users as they belong to groups and roles are assigned to them (or the groups they belong to). SCS wants users to be managed across layers of the stack and across providers to allow for federation.

Authentication and Authorization are important topics for the security of a platform. We deal with those here, but currently also the broader topics around security / penetration testing. (Findings may need to be discussed and addressed in other teams.)

----

# Team IAM/Sec

* Ongoing research into remediation of AMD cachewrap issue
* Blog article planned

----

# Team IAM/Roles

* Handover from Markus to Josephine (plus vacation time)

----

# Team IAM/IAM

* Keycloak PoC in testbed runs on k3s with CloundNativePG backend
* (scs-keycloak 23.0.1 deployed via codecentric Helm chart)
* Intro docs for operators: https://docs.scs.community/docs/iam/

---

# Team Ops

We build tooling and infrastructure design for easy, efficient and transparent ways to operate an SCS Cloud.

----

# Team Ops

* Problems with Quay.io pulling images
* Central SCS Keycloak can be hosted on SCS (Harbor) Cluster
* Want a central monitoring instance for SCS Services, e.g. Zuul
* No SIG Monitoring Meeting tomorrow

---

# SIG Central API

Discussed, if Central API Components and CAPI MGMT Components should be deployed on the same Cluser. If both use the same Namespace for Tenant Separation, probably yes.

Decided that Tenant Resources should be deployed with GitOps
