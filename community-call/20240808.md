# Team IaaS

Report by <a href="https://github.com/artificial-intelligence">@artificial-intelligence</a>

----

## Team IaaS

- [SCS compliance checks turned red for some CSPs](https://docs.scs.community/standards/certification/overview)
- please reach out to <a href="https://github.com/fkr">@fkr</a> if there are any roadblocks from the CSP side to become green again

----

## Team IaaS

- Kubernetes-powered runtime for vertical services on management plane (e.g. IDM)
- discusson if we should migrate from ansible to argocd based deployment

----

## Team IaaS

- Standard scs-0104-v1 on standard flavors revised
- no strong opinions, no objections to slightly alter the interpretation of `extra_specs` with regards to the pattern of `scs:name-vN`
- the pattern stays the same, only the meaning will change a little bit
- for details, see: issue [standards/#594](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/594), PR [standards/#677](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/677)

----

## Team Iaas

- Ability to phase out old OS images
- issue [standards/#684](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/684)
- so far we can't say that some image is "discouraged" or even "forbidden
- Q: shall we make these two values possible? (e.g., for distributions that are EOL)
- to be decided

----

## Team IaaS

- Image metadata standard: typo or grave mistake?
- decision: it's just a typo, fixed via [PR 690](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/690)
- last but not least we had a nice demo about improved OpenStack service healthchecks with oslo.middleware
- see [Issue 1046](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/1046) for details

# Team IAM & Security

Report by <a href="https://github.com/bitkeks">@bitkeks</a>

----

## Team IAM & Security

* Security report storage in S3
    * Trivy Operator scans Kubernetes clusters and creates reports
    * Problem: the reports are stored in the Kubernetes API and not exported
    * Approach 1, "pull": Write a Zuul job that fetches the reports and put them into storage
        * -> current test implementation
    * Approach 2, "push": Use a script that runs beside Trivy to push reports into S3
        * Skips dependency on Zuul
