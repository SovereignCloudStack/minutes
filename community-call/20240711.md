Report by ...

## Team IaaS

**CVE-2024-32498 / OSSA-2024-001**
- SCS Security Advisory on arbitrary file access through QCOW2 external data file
    - Read the SCS [blog post](https://scs.community/security/2024/07/02/cve-2024-32498/)
    - See the [details and related info](https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2024-001.html)
    - Building updated images 'till Tue afternoon
        - With intensive testing, except for a last minute addition
    - Providers started patching 1.5 hrs ahead of disclosure
    - Patching was effective and smooth


----

## Team IaaS

**Greenfield Rook Deployment**
- Rook Operator/Cluster available in OSISM plays (via Helm)
- Feature will be available as Tech-Preview for R7
- Try it and provide a feedback! -  e.g. via [testbed](https://github.com/osism/testbed/pull/2274)

----

## Team IaaS

**Proposal: Add node local storage to the OpenStack block storage service**
- Currently only offered through nova ephemeral storage in OpenStack 
- Proposal: Make local storage available in cinder using transparent migrations based on the [device-mapper clone target](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-clone.html)
    - It will be a new storage type in cinder
    - Currently in concept stage, see related [discussion](https://input.scs.community/2023-scs-team-iaas#Proposal-to-add-node-local-storage-to-the-OpenStack-block-storage-service-janhorstmann), PoC is next

----

## Team IaaS

**Standard: Cinder Volume Backup**
- Review it: [PR#567](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/567)
     - conflict: a) feature availability vs. b) backup reliability 
     - c) mandate backup feature and API availability AND reliability (level of independence from main storage/single location fail) properties make it transparent to users

## Team IaaS

**Standard: Role**

# Possible project extension until Dec 31, 2024

* Have officially reqested extension 'till 2024-12 now
    * No official decision yet
    * Have extended contracts with our contractors now to be prepared
        * Will not change overall budget nor the per tender package budget (but in some of them, there is budget left)
