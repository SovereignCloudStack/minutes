# Team IaaS

Report by @artificial-intelligence

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

----

## Team IaaS

Work and discussion of the following standardization topics

- Availability Zone Standard ([PR: 640](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/640))
    - first draft, feedback was provided

- Generally allow scs:name-vN extra specs
    - We have agreement that this should be allowed

----

## Team IaaS

More details can be found in the [minutes](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/minutes/blob/main/iaas/20240626.md)

# Team IAM & Security - IAM

Report by @markus-hentsch

- **Infra Security Scan Pipeline**
    - documentation has been added @ [security-infra-scan-pipeline/docs](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/security-infra-scan-pipeline/tree/main/docs)
    - Ansible & Terraform scripts for standalone DefectDojo are ready
- **CaaS Security Scan Pipeline**: initial Trivy playbooks added
    - next steps: Zuul config for daily runs & DefectDojo exporters
- **Keycloak**: work has started on supporting customer CA certificates to be imported for federation

# Team Ops

And SIG Central API

Report by @matofeder

We build tooling and infrastructure design for easy, efficient 
and transparent ways to operate an SCS Cloud.

----

## Team Ops 

**Central API**
- MVP date set to Tuesday, July 30th
- Which CSPs are involved?
    - PlusServer
    - OSISM/Regio
    - more to come ...

----

## Team Ops 

**SCS Monitoring**
- OSISM/IaaS monitoring deployment blocker [#1058](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/1058) has been resolved
- Loki in https://monitoring.scs.community will come soon
- moin cluster will be monitored by the SCS observer, see it soon at https://monitoring.scs.community
- Prometheus auto-discovery for VMs/endpoints outside k8s?
    - issue will be created

----

## Team Ops 

**Zuul**
- Node/cadvisor prometheus exporters were down
    - issue resolved right after ops call
- Re-deployment of Zuul is necessary for improved reliability
    - K8s vs VMs? -> K8s (KaaS V2)
- Should we include Zuul into the SCS deployment?
    - will be discussed

----

## Team Ops 

**Status Page**
- MVP date set to Thursday, July 18th
- “Planned maintenance” feature after MVP

# Team Container

Report by @jschoone

----

# Team Container
## Cluster-Gen UI
- GUI to create Cluster objects
- See demo at https://cluster-gen.moin.k8s.scs.community

----

# Team Container
## Moin Cluster
- Backups enabled
- now running on SSD
- more in Lightning Talk today

----

# Team Container
## Cluster Stacks
- we now have a script to generate Cluster Stacks in various versions to avoid code repetition
- Cluster Stacks for KubeVirt available soon (in Review)

----

# Team Container
## KaaS V1 daily E2E tests fixed
- also running on SSD now
- currently uses soft-anti-affinity because there are not enough compute nodes with SSDs on gx-scs SCS-1

----

# Team Container
## KaaS monitoring - from Ops meeting
- To make more use of our monitoring instance (monitoring.scs.communiy) in the Kubernetes environment, we'll add Moin Cluster next

----

# Team Container
## Standards
- KaaS Node Distribution
    - We discussed how this standard will be fulfilled when using control plane managers like Kamaji
- KaaS conformance tests with other providers/implementations
    - regio cloud and PSKE provide Gardener access to run conformance tests on
- We have a new Epic with a nice overview of the "KaaS Standards roadmap", [issues/#615](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/615)

# SIG Standardization/Certification

Report by @martinmo

----

## SIG Standardization/Certification

- Standards repository README: merge of update of [badges in table](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards?tab=readme-ov-file#scs-compatible-clouds) to scs-compatible v4 ([PR 600](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/600)) postponed (majority of clouds don't pass v4 at the moment)
  - Raises the question: why are newer scopes not adopted?
  - Multiple hypotheses have been collected & discussed
  - This will be investigated further by @fkr in preparation of a break-out session
- Badges for multiple scope versions have been proposed (as short term solution)

----

## SIG Standardization/Certification

- Discussion about how to handle "extended conformance" (i.e., if fulfilling the `SHOULD`s in standards)
- Proposals:
  - Percentages / Scores (e.g., [OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en))
  - Feature Support Matrix
  - GX Self Description / Credentials (btw, blog post [in the making](https://staging.scs.community/website/2024/06/05/demystifying-gaia-x-credentials/))
  - Multiple orthogonal scopes
- To be discussed in detail in another break-out session
