# Lightning talk today (~15:40 CET)

Yassir Ellami (Gaia-X AISBL):
The Gaia-X Trust Framework 

---

# Updates from the Teams

---

# Team IaaS

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

----

# Team IaaS

* Clevis and Tang deprecation
* [ProxySQL](https://github.com/sysown/proxysql) will be the new default (replacing haproxy)
* Domain Manager Role Standard
* API Filter service - OpenAPI specs for services
* SIG Public Cloud - Flavor Discoverability

---

# Team IAM

The Team IAM deals with topics around Identity and Access Management.

Users that access cloud and container infrastructure need to authenticate themselves and then authorizations to see and access resources from the infrastructure are derived from the identity of the users as they belong to groups and roles are assigned to them (or the groups they belong to). SCS wants users to be managed across layers of the stack and across providers to allow for federation.

Authentication and Authorization are important topics for the security of a platform. We deal with those here, but currently also the broader topics around security / penetration testing. (Findings may need to be discussed and addressed in other teams.)

----

# Team IAM/Sec

* Evaluating results of auditing and privesc scripts against testbed manager and nodes
* Blog post upcoming for Intel SA-00950 and AMD Cachewarp vulnerabilites
* Upstream work: Open Redirect Security issue in Opensearch reported to AWS/Amazon

----

# Team IAM/Roles

* Identity Spec for the Domain manager role submitted upstream [#384](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/384#issuecomment-1847157721)
* Draft for role standard written but stuck, see [#396](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/396#issuecomment-1852491416)

----

# Team IAM/IAM

* Started PoC in testbed for running Keycloak on k3s on the management plane
* scs-keycloak 23.0.1 deployed via codecentric Helm chart
* Working on getting CloudNativePG usable (for Keycloak)
* Work on Keystone mapping of federated/ephemeral users to domains has been picked up again by upstream

---

# Team Ops

We build tooling and infrastructure design for easy, efficient and transparent ways to operate an SCS Cloud.

----

# Team Ops

We did a follow up discussion to monday's topic in the lean coffee
regarding reserving resources for compute node itself.

---

# Team Container

----

# Team Container

**Welcome Paul**
* Works for B1-Systems on Tender 06a

----

# Team Container

**Cluster Stacks status**
* Good progress on Cluster Stack Provider Openstack
* Chicken-egg-problem with the documentation on the Cluster Stack definition
    * Content for the Docs will be collected on-the-fly
* ClusterClass Helm Chart to be implemented in `k8s-cluster-api-provider` to lower the gap between the reference implementations

----

# Team Container

**KaaS Hackathon in Bratislava**
* Date fixed: **5./6. March 2024**
* Planned for 15-20 people

----

# Team Container

**Standards**
* Currently some reviews open
* Good discussion on a Standards regarding kaas test suite
    * suggestions to use CAPI test framework to avoid inventing the wheel again

---

# SIG Documentation

did not happen due to lack of participation

---

# SIG Std/Cert
<!-- CURRENT as of 2023-12-14 -->
The SIG standardization and certification discusses how we approach standardization, how we develop and approve standards and manage their lifecycle, how we validate providers, how certificates are handed out, what the policies around them are (e.g. validity).

---

# SIG Std/Cert
<!-- CURRENT as of 2023-12-14 -->

- Recap of the Community Hackathon
    - try out the following idea by means of one or two examples: make _implementation effort_ and _testing considerations_ explicit by providing one supplemental document for each standard
    - potentially provide a tool that tests workloads for SCS portability
- How to categorize standards and certificates according to editorial status and effectiveness
    - distinguish draft, stable (but not yet effective), effective (possibly soon deprecated), deprecated (and no longer effective)

---

# Lean Operator coffee

* The reservations of cpu and ram resources for critical node services
* Multiple Monitoring Servers - Do's Dont's and Howtos
* Networking stuff
  (feedback is very welcome, contact Angel Kafazov)
    * The usage of Sonic switches with CSPs
    * challenges of network scaling
    * ideas for network scaling

---

# Hacking sessions: IAM hacking session

# Hacking sessions: Community Pages

# SIG Central API

not this week
-->

# Adoption

* OS Health Monitor at artcodix
* dataport SCS environment now complete ðŸš€

---

# Tenders

* VP03 (storage technology): The tender has now been finalised. The award decision has been made and the funds have been released by the Ministry. As soon as the written notification is received, the contract will also be formally concluded. Congratulations to B1 Systems GmbH.
* VP09b-2 (supply chain security): It is planned to carry out this tender again. The reason for this is that there was no bid in the last tender that was acceptable.

---

# Open Door Sessions (Reminder)

* Beginning in January felix will offer a weekly open door session
* This session is dedicated to Operators (even weeks) and Integrators (odd weeks) in order to facilitate various product feedback
* Thursdays 12:05 CET/CEST

# Lightning talk

#### Yassir Ellami (Gaia-X AISBL):
#### The Gaia-X Trust Framework
![](https://input.scs.community/uploads/f60e43c6-99a0-4a88-bcf1-754c129fa450.png)

What is "Trust" in a data exchange context and how to achieve it ?
How is each aspect of Trust used in Gaia-X and how is that deployed with the Digital Clearing Houses?
