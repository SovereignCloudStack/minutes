# Team IaaS

Report by <a href="https://github.com/matofeder">@matofeder</a>

----

### Team IaaS

**Standards**
- Instance metadata issue [#580](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/580)
    - Outcome: Document that a non-scs prefixes could be used by those who want to use this facility; any item whose name doesn’t start with scs is not portable
- Entropy standard [#673](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/673)
    - Bug in check script: according to the standard, absence of `rngd` is an ERROR, whereas the test script only reports a WARNING
    - It is required to have the service present and running
    - Outcome: leave this as is right now and introduce new revision of the standard (changing language from “installed” to “running”)

----

### Team IaaS

**Standards**
- Role Standard / Domain Manager standard [#590](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/590)
    - There was a issue between enforce_scope/enforce_new_defaults and the SCS implementation of the Domain Manager role
    - With Keystone 2024.2 no blocker for the new role model seems to be remaining
- Cinder Volume Backup API standard [#673](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/673)
    - Call for the review
    - Current standard draft says:
        - MUST configure and offer volume backup API
        - SHOULD use dedicated storage backend for backups

----

### Team IaaS

**Local storage via OpenStack block storage - DEMO**
- PoC: [Cinder driver concept based on the device-mapper clone target](https://scs.community/2024/07/12/local-block-storage-via-dm-clone/)
- Explore: [PoC driver](https://github.com/janhorstmann/openstack-cinder/tree/feature/dev/dm-clone-driver) in a [testbed installation](https://github.com/osism/testbed/tree/preview/cinder_local_volumes)

## Team IAM & Security


- Pipelines have been adapted to store the results in S3 bucket
    - Concers about non-zuul services and app credentials separation
    - Expiration of files should be handled by storage
- Config for SCS S3 object storage date
    - Credentials, expiration,...
- Proposal of creating small export app for Trivy, so it can handle vault credential fetching

# Team Ops

Report by <a href="https://github.com/bitkeks">@bitkeks</a>

## Team Ops

* Report from Central API SIG: Tech Preview is ready!
    * [docs.scs.community/docs/operating-scs/components/central-api/](https://docs.scs.community/docs/operating-scs/components/central-api/poc-setup)
* Updates on the Status page in regards to planned maintenance
    * Also side-topic: handling of Github applications
* Discussion regarding stability of monitoring.scs.community -> Container call
* Building container images in Zuul

# Team Container

Report by <a href="https://github.com/martinmo">@martinmo</a>


----

## Team Container 

**Issues with the K8s cluster hosting monitoring.scs.community**

- (maybe skip this slide if this was already handled by Team Ops report)
- Grafana instance isn't stable, availability issues
- Likely caused by unhealthy etcd of the K8s cluster
- Moving K8s control plane nodes to instances with local SSD (flavor with `s` suffix)
  should help and will be done by @chess-knight


----

## Team Container

**Support of custom, self-signed CA certificates in CSPO**

- "How to use CSPO with self-signed OpenStack API certs?"
- Workaround: add `verify: false` into `clouds.yaml`
- Proper: CA cert should be put into the cloud `Secret` (under `cacert` key)
- CSPO supports cacert in latest v0.1.0-alpha.4
- [openstack-csp-helper](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/openstack-csp-helper) chart currently doesn't support this (issue [#5](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/openstack-csp-helper/issues/5))

----

## Team Container

**Master node placement across AZs with Cluster Stacks**

- CAPO allows configuring the AZs to which the control plane nodes are deployed
  (or which should be omitted)
- However, you can't control this with Cluster Stacks yet (the corresponding
  `OpenStackClusterSpec` fields are not exposed)
- This is important, e.g., wrt to PVCs created in different AZs
- Support for this will be implemented
