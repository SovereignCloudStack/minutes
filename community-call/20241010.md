# Team IaaS

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS 

Report by <a href="https://github.com/matofeder">@matofeder</a>

----

## Team IaaS

- [Orphaned resources in OpenStack after project (or domain) deletion  ](https://input.scs.community/2023-scs-team-iaas#Management-of-orphaned-Openstack-resources-scoopex)
    - When a project/domain is deleted in OpenStack, its resources (such as LBs, volumes, or networks) are not automatically cleaned up, leading to orphaned resources that consume system resources
    - OpenStack does not prevent deletion of non-empty projects, nor does it automatically clean up all associated resources
    - The current design appears inefficient and may lead to operational challenges, especially for cloud operators

----

## Team IaaS

- Options for Addressing Orphaned Resources
    - Disallow project deletion, Require projects to be empty before deletion, Asynchronous/Synchronous cleanup, Cascaded deletion, etc.
- Strawman proposal
    - It makes OpenStack project deletion asynchronous, allowing Keystone to query services in the catalog to check for associated resources. If resources are found, the user is required to clean them up before the project can be deleted

# Team IAM & Security

Report by <a href="https://github.com/juanptm">@JuanPTM</a>

----

## Security

- WIP: Documentation extension about tools and reports
- WIP: Checking logs about why pipeline is failing
- Researching of SBOM tooling

----

## Federation

- Discussion: shared vs individual realm
- Shared
    - Advantage: All users end up in the same DB
    - Listing users that have access to the tenant works well
- How to add external IdPs in shared config

---

# Team Container

Report by <a href="https://github.com/kgube">@kgube</a>

----

- Standardization of k8s networking features (NetworkPolicies, Gateway API, ...) in KaaS-v1
	- avoid vendor-specific extensions (e.g. Cilium's Host Firewall)
- Updated k8s version policy
	- CSPs now have 2 weeks time to provide new patch version instead of 1
- Should operators force customers to upgrade their clusters to stay SCS-compliant?
	- Differentiate between responsibilities of CSP and customer
	- <a href="https://github.com/garloff">@garloff</a> will survey CSPs on how upgrades are handled and whether they are enforced

- No SIG Std/Cert on Oct 17, Oct 24 will happen (facilitation by @garloff)
- KaaS-v1 (w/ mandatory network policies!) on track for November, also IaaS-v5
- GPUs in flavor names will receive an optional VRAM size, better explanations and a table (compliance-preserving change)
