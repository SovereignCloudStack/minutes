# Team IaaS

Rebort by @matusjenca2

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

----

# Team IaaS
- Barbican Plugin / Key-Manager Standard
    - Issue:[#509](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/509) Standard:[#599](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/599)
    -  Key-Manager SHOULD be used
    -  CSPs SHOULD NOT store the Master-KEK in plain-text on the physical host 
 - Role Standard
     - [#590](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/590)
    - Heat incompatibility 

----


# Team IaaS

- DNS Standard 
    - Issue: [#229](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/229) PR: [#570](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/570)
    - open topics in the PR
    - breakout session
- Standard Images unintuitive from CSP point of view
    - Issue [#534](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/534)
    -  standardizes the *process of creating* the list of standard images not *how* CSPs are supposed to actually implement the image

---

# Team IaaS

- Provider Network Standard
    - Issues: [#166](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/166), [#167](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/167) PR: [#572](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/572)
    - Review needed
    - Community Question: does SCS require internet access for i.e. airgap structures?

---


# Team IAM & Security - IAM

The Team IAM deals with topics around Identity and Access Management.

Sovereign Cloud Stack has the goal that user identities can used across several layers in the stack (most importantly IaaS and Container layer), that user management should be a self-service capability and that user identities can be federated.

Authentication and Authorization are important topics for the security of a platform. We deal with those here, but currently also the broader topics around security / penetration testing.

----

# Team IAM & Security - IAM / Security

* Role Standard
    * Positive feedback from upstream
* Federation Keystone - Keycloak
    * Required changes pushed for review
    * Setup would need to change

----

# Team IAM & Security - IAM / Security

* Work on "weekly" scans pipeline in progress
* Overall documentation about Security in SCS to be started soon

---

# Team Ops

We build tooling and infrastructure design for easy, efficient 
and transparent ways to operate an SCS Cloud.

----

# Team Ops 

- **IaaS Monitoring:** 

    - SCS Monitoring Platform includes OpenStack API Exporter and Dashboard, Port for OSISM Codebase in on review
    - Ceph Integration ongoing, Exporters present, Dashboards are being evaluated

- **Central API:** Managed to deploy Gardener Cluster with Central API as a PoC. Next step: Same for ClusterAPI and more config parameters for User Facing API

- **Cloudmon/Stackmon:** PR [standards#576](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/576) still open for review

---

# Team Container

Report by @mxmxchere

----

moin-cluster improvements:
- RBAC roles for "SCS-tenants" / access to playground namespaces
- pre-equipped playgrounds namespaces with credentials and clusterstacks
- "prod" components "external-dns, ingress" now managed by flux
- better dependency checks between different components

----

- Sync cluster stack "scs" with "alpha"
- upstream work by @chess-knight to make kamaji cluster-class ready
- new cluster stack for kubevirt
- New releases for csctl (v0.0.3) and csctl-plugin-openstack (v0.0.1)

# SIG Monitoring

# All teams

* Github's DCO checker was broken for ~ a week
    * This prevented merges into protected branches (`main` and friends)
* Maintainers (SCS team) force-merged PR after manually checking
* Workaround built in standards repo (own DCO checker as github action)
* Things started working again this morning
* SCS R7 scheduled for 2024-09-04
