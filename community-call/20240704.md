# Team IaaS

Report by @matofeder

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

----

## Team IaaS

**CVE-2024-32498 / OSSA-2024-001**
- SCS Security Advisory on arbitrary file access through QCOW2 external data file
    - Read the SCS [blog post](https://scs.community/security/2024/07/02/cve-2024-32498/)
    - See the [details and related info](https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2024-001.html)
    - Building updated images 'till Tue afternoon
        - With intensive testing, except for a last minute addition
    - Providers started patching 1.5 hrs ahead of disclosure
    - Patching was effective and smooth


----

## Team IaaS

**Greenfield Rook Deployment**
- Rook Operator/Cluster available in OSISM plays (via Helm)
- Feature will be available as Tech-Preview for R7
- Try it and provide a feedback! -  e.g. via [testbed](https://github.com/osism/testbed/pull/2274)

----

## Team IaaS

**Proposal: Add node local storage to the OpenStack block storage service**
- Currently only offered through nova ephemeral storage in OpenStack 
- Proposal: Make local storage available in cinder using transparent migrations based on the [device-mapper clone target](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-clone.html)
    - It will be a new storage type in cinder
    - Currently in concept stage, see related [discussion](https://input.scs.community/2023-scs-team-iaas#Proposal-to-add-node-local-storage-to-the-OpenStack-block-storage-service-janhorstmann), PoC is next

----

## Team IaaS

**Standard: Cinder Volume Backup**
- Review it: [PR#567](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/567)
     - conflict: a) feature availability vs. b) backup reliability 
     - c) mandate backup feature and API availability AND reliability (level of independence from main storage/single location fail) properties make it transparent to users

----

## Team IaaS

**Standard: Role**
- Review it: [PR#590](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/590)

# Team IAM & Security

Report by @garloff

----

## Team IAM & Security - Security

* Short report on [CVE-2024-32498](https://scs.community/de/security/2024/07/02/cve-2024-32498/)
* Patch your openssh-server! ([CVE-2024-6387](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/pull/971/files?short_path=de075a2#diff-de075a2a9f83a3640db1c5df6f31e01428b1b45e864bf479a87fbcf47ada6888))
* Scanner pipeline work
* Trivy cluster scanner 
    * Archival of results needs work (object storage)

----

## Team IAM & Security - IAM

* Key Manager standard (manage user keys for disk and TLS network encryption)
    * Review wanted for [PR #599](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/599)
    * Currently it does not (yet?) make Key Manager (e.g. OpenStack barbican) mandatory

----

## Team IAM & Security - IAM

* OpenStack Secure RBAC research vs role standard [PR#590](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/590)
    * OpenStack Core Services support secRBAC, 50% have it enabled by default, increasing
        * This will be the default in 2024.2 (Dalmatian)
        * heat blocker has been solved
    * Will bring more consistent role handling
        * No more special roles for octavia, barbican needed
        * Decision: Use `policy.yaml` to make barbican behave already now (-> Key Manager Standard)
    * Conflicts with our domain manager role *implementation*
        * Expect to bring our domain manager *concept* upstream
        * Switch should be painless
* Expect to adopt Secure RBAC with R8 (OSISM 9) in spring 2025, as this includes OpenStack 2024.2
