# Updates from the Teams

---

# Team IaaS

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

----

# Team IaaS
**Encryption between user workloads**

* Idea: Create a plugin for Neutron using eBPF to secure the traffic automatically
* Concerns regarding feasability
* Start by specifying attacker model until next meeting

---

# Team IaaS
**IaaS standard for custom images**

* scs-0104-v1-standard-images was changed
* Removed wording regarding minimum allowed uploaded images by users
* Replaced with "fair use"

---

# Team IaaS
**Future of Ceph day-2 tooling**

* Migration to rook: "hacky" but working POC against OSISM testbed
* Still work to do for migration with all resources/meta data
* Consideration: Some resources need to be defined on ceph layer instead of rook
* Investigation pending...

---

# Team IAM & Security

----

# Roles

* Upstreaming the Domain Manager role is progressing (slowly)
    * Old way will be used until implementation is completed
* Feedback needed for the 'Role Standard' PR
* How does Keycloak's federation works with OpenStack scopes?

----

# Keycloak deployment on control plane

* Targeting RC1 with better keycloak integration
    * TLS, CNPG operator, etc...
* Several PR towards OSISM repos
* Upgraded to Keycloak 23.0.6

----

# Keystone
* Upstream patch still waiting
* Next steps are being discussed


----

# Security & pentest

* Low and High privileged user assesments finished over testbed manager and nodes.
    * Results and recommendations uploaded to SCS nextcloud instance.

---

# Team Ops

We build tooling and infrastructure design for easy, efficient 
and transparent ways to operate an SCS Cloud.

----

# Team Ops

- Zuul Reporting ChatOps works well, will be stabilized next week
- Testbed Monitoring now experimental included into Observability Cluster
- Status page default view rendering will be avaiable next week
    - For K8s Deployment we still wait on DNS records

---

# SIG Central API

- Discussion on [Reasoning and concept document](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/central-api/pull/4)
- Discussion around Central API and SCS CSP interoperability
    - Mainly about integration with Cluster Stacks
    - Who provides cluster classes, who will be the K8s provider
    - Will start to create an ADR on definition of personas (CSPs, etc.) to a have an opinionated view on the architecture

# Team Container

----

# Team Container

**ClusterStackProviderOpenStack**
Proposal to make some fields optionial: [cluster-stack-provider-openstack/#90](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-provider-openstack/issues/90)
 - valuable inputs from the community have been collected
 - the discussion has been moved to the related issue

----

# Team Container

**Container registry**
- documentation has been refactored and prepared to be ready for the *new* format of docs.scs.community
