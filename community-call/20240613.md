# Team IaaS

Report by @artificial-intelligence

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

----

## Team IaaS

- [Supported IaaS (Openstack) Service List](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/587)
    - result of the discussion was to focus more on the availability of APIs (e.g. compute API) instead of services (e.g. nova)
    - the APIs itself are huge and complex, need to work through them
    - as a starting point the Openstack Interop Guideline tests can be used

----


## Team IaaS

- DNS and OVN
    - analysis of the behaviour can be found [here](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/229#issuecomment-2066368242)
    - we want to make it configurable for the customer of a CSP either per tenant or per (sub)network if OVN answers certain DNS queries
    - this is currently only possible for the CSP on a global level
    - TODO: Create a blueprint/spec for Openstack neutron, Volunteers wanted!

# Team IAM & Security - IAM

Report by @JuanPTM

The Team IAM deals with topics around Identity and Access Management.

Sovereign Cloud Stack has the goal that user identities can used across several layers in the stack (most importantly IaaS and Container layer), that user management should be a self-service capability and that user identities can be federated.

Authentication and Authorization are important topics for the security of a platform. We deal with those here, but currently also the broader topics around security / penetration testing.

----

## Team IAM & Security - IAM / Security

### Key Manager Standard

- Feedback needed and positive/negative examples

----

## Team IAM & Security - IAM / Security

- Setup example guide and playbook merged!
- Importing multiple CAs into keycloak first PoC
- Moving build container into zuul

----

## Team IAM & Security - IAM / Security

### Taxonomy of failsafe levels

- Initial MR
    - Asking for review


----

## Team IAM & Security - IAM / Security

### Pentesting

- MR for weekly scans
    - Discussion about having a dedicated image to save time
    - Working on documentation for operators
- Testing Trivy deployment on Zuul

# Team Ops

Report by @matofeder

We build tooling and infrastructure design for easy, efficient 
and transparent ways to operate an SCS Cloud.

----

## Team Ops 

**IaaS monitoring**

- Ceph monitoring instegration into SCS monitoring platform [#56](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/pull/56)
     - Try it, read the [docs](https://docs.scs.community/docs/operating-scs/components/monitoring/docs/iaas#ceph)

- Ongoing
    - Loki on monitoring.scs.community [#50](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/issues/50)
    - Porting SCS work to the dNation upstream [#57](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/issues/57)

---

## Team Ops 

**Status Page**


- Status Page Observability [#653](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/653)
    - Enable metrics of 3rd party components (PG, Dex, ..), status page API and integration into the SCS monitoring platform


---

## Team Ops 

**Zuul**

- OIDC admin login for Zuul webinterface [#432](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/432)
    - Enqueueing/dequeueing of pipelines will be easily accessible
    - GitHub OIDC integration will be used
- Zuul job for building/pushing container images to the SCS registry [#518](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/518)
    - Workflow: "code to Github -> Zuul builds container -> Zuul pushes to registry.scs"
    - SCS registry then performs the security scanning (Trivy) and **[SBOM](https://goharbor.io/docs/edge/administration/sbom-integration/)** generation!

# Team Container

Report by @garloff

----

**CNCF e2e test failures on KaaS v1 clusters on gx-scs**

- Want to keep these working until R7 (by when we want to have all users migrated to v2)
- Failures likely caused by frequent etcd leader changes caused by high disk I/O latency on gx-scs
- SSD flavors (e.g. `SCS-2V-4-20s`) now available there, use for control-plane (etcd) nodes

----

**PlusServer maintenance metadata side-discussion**

- PS Docs [PlusServer docs](https://docs.plusserver.com/en/compute/pluscloudopen/reference/local-storage/)
    - PS announces regular host maintenance via instance metadata (so we could react by polling, which is what PSKE does)
    - VM restart after maintenance as opt-in (via per instance metadata)
        - Maybe should be opt-out
- Should this be standardized by SCS?
    - Move this to team IaaS

----

**Kamaji support**

- Patches have been merged, Kamaji works with ClusterStacks now
- Allows for a shared control plane (saves resources, faster cluster creation)
- Discussion on anti-affinity policies
    - Watch out on gx-scs b/c of limited resources
    - In general hard anti-affinity is a good choice for the control plane

----

**Generic node images vs pre-built ubuntu-capi- images**

- With a few kubeadm-pre commands, generic images work
- Maybe a better option for clouds that don't have the ubuntu-capi- images provided by operator
    - Installing a few packages is faster than image registration
- Option will be pursued, but best seems still to be providers with the recommended ubuntu-capi- images
    - These are closer to an immutable VM paradigm

----

**Moin cluster status**

- Failed load-balancer service
    - Maybe issue OSISM #959
- Fix on short notice yesterday
- New ingress needed to make it work again
- Also trouble with etcd -> migrate to SSD flavors

---

# SIG Standardization

Report by @garloff

----

**`scs-namevN` extra specs**

- These were disallowed per our spec (and tests) for non-mandatory and non-recommended flavors
- Not practical, will be changed (v2 standard)
- Open questions:
    - Several flavors with the same `scs-namevN` allowed?
    - Several `scs-namevN` names in one flavor allowed?
- Will also run this via team IaaS

----

**instance metadata**

- standards/#580
- see PlusServer Docs (team KaaS)
- such conventions would be useful to define at SCS
- move to team IaaS

----

**Dealing with laggards in adopting latest SCS compliance versions**

- Still testing and displaying old compliance versions
- Compliance monitor will automate using only the current versions
- Formal grace periods
- Display tested version (and also link to action with detailed results)
