# Team IaaS
Update for the Fernet situation

# Team Container

**Standards**

- Node distribution standard has been stabilized
    - Standard REQUIRES certain node labels:
        - `topology.kubernetes.io/region`
        - `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` 
        - `topology.scs.community/host-id`

- Can we update Node distribution standard from v1 to v2?
    - Will be discussed in the SIG Standardization meeting

----

# Team Container

**KaaS V1/V2**

- Migration from KaaS V1 to V2 - almost DONE
    - [Migration guide](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/544#issuecomment-1999746262) - call for testing
- V2 CSCTL plugin OpenStack - almost DONE
    - [PR#92](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/csctl/pull/92) - call for testing
- Cluster-stacks GitHub releases
    - Goal: Reproducable builds
    - Ideas: csctl taging support, CI integration ...

----

# Team Container

**GX-SCS high disk latency issue**

- SCS-2V-4-20s and SCS-4V-16-100s flavors will be available soon
- In the meantime:
    - The PS team will be informed about our observation
    - Etcd heartbeat interval and election timeout will be temporary increased
    - Etcd cluster with a dedicated file-system and/or disk

---

# Team IAM & Security

Report by @bitkeks

## Special call: R6 retro and goals for R7

- Start doing:
    - Prepare agenda earlier, review links and docs
    - Sync with IaaS as routine
    - More short-term goals, concrete tasks like patches and docs
    - Keycloak improvements, tests for federated login, documentation for onboarding, security notifications in Zuul

----

# Team IAM & Security

- Continue doing:
    - Team has good workflow
    - Following up long-running tasks like Domain manager role is worth the investment into upstream
    - More docs and presentations regarding security coming
    - Special breakout sessions proved efficient

----

# Team IAM & Security

- Stop doing:
    - Skip repeating topics, pay more attention to repetition
- Action Items (AIs): 6 in total
    - Lightning talk about current state of security
    - Tests for federated login, using those as base for examples

----

# Team IAM & Security

- "Original Plan" vs "Our work for R6"
- Define goals for R7 -> fly lower

---

# Team Ops

We build tooling and infrastructure design for easy, efficient 
and transparent ways to operate an SCS Cloud.

----

# Team Ops 

- **General:** New GH Label for work on VP12
- **Status Page:** Got Live Demo + Techdemo available in about two weeks
- **Observability Stack:** Kubernetes Monitoring Deployment part of OSISM codebase

    - Work on known issues
    - Wiring monitoring plattform with Thanos sidecar

---

# SIG Standardization/Certification

Report by @martinmo

- Node distribution standard extensions
  - new required node labels to make testing possible
    - `topology.kubernetes.io/region`
    - `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`
    - `topology.scs.community/host-id`
  - we decided to create v2 of the standard to adhere to our process
- New certificate scope versions for R6
  - scs-compatible-iaas v4: stable since 2024-02-28
  - scs-compatible-kaas v1: working draft, plan: stable in mid April
    - as of now, not everything can be conformance tested
- License for conformance test scripts
  - some inconsistencies, should be CC license
  - missing SPDX identifiers in some scripts
  - will be cleaned up and probably be checked automatically in future
- Talk at OpenInfra Day, May 15

----

## SCS is here to stay

# Community Member Pages

* We have now linked the [Community Members Page](https://scs.community/members/) on the website under the menu item "Discover SCS".
* Why do we periodically address this topic?
  Improved abilities to communicate, share and discuss is an important factor to increas our success as a community. Especially when a community like ours pursues an exchange of users and the "Open Operations" paradigm.
* Just raise a pull request, as Eduard described that with his [blog article](https://scs.community/2023/01/27/community-profiles/)
* New profile pages are [not indexed by Google](https://scs.community/robots.txt)
