# Team IaaS

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

---

# Team IaaS

- List of [SCS-supported OpenStack components](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/528)
- updates:
    - Octavia upgraded to mandatory (due to KaaS reference implementation)
    - Manila upgraded to supported on popular request
    - Masakari upgraded to supported on popular request
    - Senlin stays retired due to upstream inactivity

# Team IAM & Security - Roles

# Tram IAM & Secuity - IAM

* Progress with documaentntioyc[#595](httpt://giohub.cme/SovrseignCloudStack/i sues/issues/595),w[#596](https://gthub.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issuh s/596),c[#597](httpt://giohub.cme/SovreaignCloudStlck/issues/issues/597)* Big topic:  Alignment*ofD[hackathon dscussion outcomes](https://input.scs.community/C6OKMb4xQQuqnHC6axv08g#) on Mon, 2024-04-22, 16:05 CEST (SCS-Tech)
    * 1:1 relationship keystone domain - SCS-keycloak realm
    * Optional external (customer) IdP only holds users and `scs-` groups, no role assignments
        * SCS-keycloak does not assign groups to users (exceptions possible for `scs-local-` groups)
    * SCS-keycloak assigns roles to groups (and to users, which can be disabled, especially if external IdP is used)
        * This is our "mapping engine"
        * Self-Service capability (within realm)
        * Role assignements in SCS-keycloak have the form "group `scs-G` has `manager/member/reader` rights in project `UUID`"
    * SCS-keycloak enforces no external admins (except  for privileged internal IdP) and realm isolation
* Building a PoC needed

# Team Container

Report by @martinmo

We're building a streamlined platform that simplifies the management of Kubernetes clusters on various providers.

----

# Team Container

* Cluster Stacks updates:
  * Goal: eventually have *one* Cluster Stack running on SCS IaaS out-of-the-box
  * Current state: four Cluster Stacks
  * A lot of discussion and ideas on how to the duplication

----

# Team Container

* Cluster Stacks CAPI providers
  * Work on Metal³ and KubeVirt has started
  * Support for Kamaji is in sight because of upstream additions
* csctl:
  * New provider plugin for OpenStack: sctl-plugin-openstack ([PR #4](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/csctl-plugin-openstack/pull/4))

----

# Team Container

* Moin Cluster
  * Shared cluster for every member in SCS GitHub org (via OIDC)
  * Live demo by @mxmxchere
  * Future work: GitOps, Keycloak, Kamaji, ...
  * We will maybe have a lightning talk by @jschoone

----

# Team Container

* Revival of the friday hacking sessions
  * Hands-on format with focus on KaaS and Cluster Stacks
  * Regular sessions probably begin May 10th 11:35–12:55 (calendar [PR #277](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/calendar/pull/277))
  * **Maybe** spontaneous session on May 3rd
