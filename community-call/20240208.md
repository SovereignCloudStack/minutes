Standard has been merged
* Follow up question, do we keep the policy file on the standard ?discussing)

----

# Roles

* Old vs new policy options
    * We staying with the old ones for the time being
* There would be a migration for old to new ones eventually

---

# Welcome ... 

Any newcomers?

---

* R6 is scheduled for 2024-03-20
* Release candidate schedule published:
  [Blog post](https://scs.community/2024/02/01/road-ro-r6/)
      * RC0 available - Test, Test, Test

# Updates from the Teams

---

# Team IaaS

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

----

# Team IaaS
**Encryption between user workloads**

* Idea: Create a plugin for Neutron using eBPF to secure the traffic automatically
* Concerns regarding feasability
* Start by specifying attacker model until next meeting
* Upstream patch still waiting
* Next steps are being discussed

- Zuul Reporting ChatOps works well, will be stabilized next week
- Testbed Monitoring now experimental included into Observability Cluster
- Status page default view rendering will be avaiable next week
    - For K8s Deployment we still wait on DNS records
**ClusterStackProviderOpenStack**
Proposal to make some fields optionial: [cluster-stack-provider-openstack/#90](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-provider-openstack/issues/90)
 - valuable inputs from the community have been collected
 - the discussion has been moved to the related issue
- documentation has been refactored and prepared to be ready for the *new* format of docs.scs.community
- ADR: Sonobuoy as a KaaS test framework [#392](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/392) 

---

# SIG Central API (1/2)

- Work on **standards** (KaaS Observability Architecture, ADR on Status Page API)
- **Zuul dev instance**: final work WIP
    - SCS-own Zuul role will be continued
    - duplicates with OSISM Ansible-roles will be resolved (OSISM first)
- **Zuul Bot Reporting**
    - the Matrix channel "Zuul Reports" get's filled with alerts - *who cares?*
    - We worked out a ChatOps workflow open for everyone

----

# Team Ops (2/2)

- **Status page** is WIP and will produce results in release R6
- **Central API**: continued work on API design/process in PR #4
    - Sync and discussion in next Team IaaS
**IaaS standard for custom images**

* scs-0104-v1-standard-images was changed
* Removed wording regarding minimum allowed uploaded images by users
* Replaced with "fair use"
* Targeting RC1 with better keycloak integration
    * TLS, CNPG operator, etc...
* Several PR towards OSISM repos
* Upgraded to Keycloak 23.0.6

---

# Team IaaS
**Future of Ceph day-2 tooling**

* Migration to rook: "hacky" but working POC against OSISM testbed
* Still work to do for migration with all resources/meta data
* Consideration: Some resources need to be defined on ceph layer instead of rook
* Investigation pending...

---

# Team IAM & Security

- Standard stabilization

- Demo on csmctl and tilt
    - tool to create cluster stacks

----

# Roles

* Upstreaming the Domain Manager    - w
 role is progressing (slowly)
    * Old way will be used until implementation is completed
* Feedback needed for the 'Role Standard' PR
* How does Keycloak's federation works with OpenStack scopes?

----

# Keycloak deployment on control plane


----

# Keystone

----

# Security

* Working on Greenbone CE implementation into the automated pentesting pipeline.
* Terraform `.tfstate` files should NEVER be in git

---

# Team Ops

We build tooling and infrastructure design for easy, efficient 
and transparent ways to operate an SCS Cloud.
