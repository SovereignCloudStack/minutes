# SCS Tech Weekly 2023-06-08

## Meta

- Minutes: Jonas

## Team updates

### Team Container

Minutes: None yet

- Registry topics
  - harbor rate limits
  - custom registry for the reference implementation WIP
- Example cluster stacks

### Team IaaS

Minutes: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/minutes/blob/main/iaas/20230607.md

- Entropy in VMs
  - Updated draft standard for state-of-the-art
  - Decisions:
    - Compute node CPUs MUST have a hardware RNG
    - Guest kernel MUST be sufficiently recent to make use of that
      - This is a constraint on the mandatory images specified from SCS; this does not mean that cloud providers offering ancient kernels are automatically non-compliant
    - RECOMMEND virtio-rng 
- SSD compute flavors
  - New mandatory flavors which have SSD-backed storage (for hosting etcd)
- Separate mandatory flavor list and the naming scheme standard (in the E sprint)
  - As it's possible to describe flavors without the naming scheme, this decouples things

### Team Ops

Minutes: None yet.

Happy cadaver day, nobody showed up.

### Team IAM

Minutes: None yet.

- Review of ongoing tasks
- Domain admin role discussion (follow-up from the lean operator coffee on monday)
  - We need this, but it's not clear how to achieve that

- Role+group naming standard WIP
- Work on Keystone upstream continues
- ADR stabilization ongoing
- Work on avoiding Keystone container restart when adding customer
