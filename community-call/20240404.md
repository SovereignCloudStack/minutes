# Updates from the Teams

---

# Team IaaS

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

Report by @fdobrovolny

----

# Team IaaS

* Continue development of redis TLS
* [Work on the VMware ESXi migration guide](https://github.com/osism/osism.github.io/pull/403)
* RHEL / CentOS compute nodes with SCS OSISM - Testers needed
* Debian ARM compute node support in works

----

## Team IaaS - SCS Lab - Current state

* All hardware deployment and cabling in completeded and in place
* [Publishing of the new documentation repo is in progress](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/hardware-landscape)
* Layer3 routing (BGP) setup in the production area with Enterprise Sonic
* Acceptance process for lot-completion with the datacenter provider is in progress
* SCS test deployments

----

## Team IaaS - SCS Lab - Next Steps

* Automation/completion of the network access setup for all environments (Layer2, Jumphost)
* Creating a optimized SCS Deployment
* Establish public /24 public subnet
* Keycloak, Promethies, Openstack
* Migration of the routing setup to our Community SONiC builds


----

# Team IaaS
* User Data Backup standard [standards#541](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/541)
* VP10 - IPv4/IPv6 Standardization - Breakout session

----

# Team IaaS
* OSISM 7.0.1 (aka SCS IaaS R6.0.1) released
    * Fixes two octavia issues mentioned in release notes (#890, #925)
    * Already deployed on gx-scs

---

# Team Container

We're building a streamlined platform that simplifies the management of Kubernetes clusters on various providers.

Report by @martinmo

---

# Team Container

- Enhancements for cluster-stacks currently in review:
  - Replace hardcoded K8s version with version from the clusterspec ([PR #20](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/20))
  - Automatic creation of GitHub releases ([PR #51](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/51))

----

# Team Container

- Discussion of alternatives for vulnerability scanning in K8s clusters (including the actual cluster components)
  - Background: needed for version policy standard ([scs-0210-v2](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0210-v2-k8s-version-policy.md)) – for conformance CSPs should patch critical CVEs within a specific timeframe
  - Current (custom) check approach will be replaced with a standard solution that is better to maintain
  - Conclusion: MVP using trivy will be developed ([#526](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/526))

# Team IAM & Security

Report by @reqa

----

# Team IAM & Security
- Started planing for R7
    - Document Keycloak container image build for updates [#595](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/595)
    - Setup & Document example customer domain/realm for federation [#596](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/596)
    - Will not invest time into backporting individual patches from Caracal/2024.1 release
    - Allow SCS-Operators to import customer domain CA certificates into Keycloak [#597](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/596)

----

# Team IAM & Security

- Security
    - Pentesting Pipeline - DefectDojo demo
    - Security epics planning for R7

---

# Team Ops

We build tooling and infrastructure design for easy, efficient 
and transparent ways to operate an SCS Cloud.

----

# Team Ops 

* SCS Infrastructure is currently down, Troubleshooting and recovery already seem to be in progress
* Disucssion of the deployment methods for the SCS status page application for different purposes:
    * Development mode, customizing the status page
    * A simple deployment
    * A production environment

---

# SIG Standardization/Certification

Report by @martinmo

----

# SIG Standardization/Certification

- v2 of node distribution standard will be merged in draft state instead of stable, because the time horizon for an implementation in KaaS (v2) is unclear (depends on upstream)
- discussion about standardizing yawol as an alternative load balancer to Octavia (https://github.com/stackitcloud/yawol/)
  - not yet conclusive
  - yawol requires Kubernetes

----

# SIG Standardization/Certification

- Work on *Compliance Monitor* was presented by @mbuechse
  - Replacement for the badges that are shown in the landing page of the standards repository
  - Solves a lot of issues with the existing approach, for example:
    - can differentiate between failures caused by test script bugs and failures caused by non-compliance
    - supports running compliance tests offline and submitting results (also partially)
    - and more

# Project end

**The funding from BMWK ends on 2024-09-30**
* We will have some money left, but can't extend beyond end of September
* Need to finish funded work ~mid September, so all invoices can be paid by Sep 30
* Time sheets must be available around Sep 12, invoices Sep 16
* Speed up work where possible in collaboration with your PO
<br/>

## SCS is here to stay
* There will be two entities carrying forward the project into 2025, 26, ...
    * non-profit for standards, brand, neutral ecosystem, ... (@OSBA)
    * commercial open source company offering maintance, support
* Good discussions with operators and partners ongoing

---

# Adoption
* ITZ Bund tender (up to 410M€/5a) went to IONOS
    * As expected
        * due to prior work, feature list, non-requested OSS, lack of DVC strategy relation
    * Still would have been nice for partner and SCS
* Looking forward to talk more about ByCS (Bayern Cloud Schule)
* Looking forward for ScaleUp offerings
* May 24: Linux-Magazin 6/24 (DE publication) with SCS focus
