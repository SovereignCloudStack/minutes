# Team IAM & Security

Report by ? <a href="https://github.com/garloff">@garloff</a>

----

## Federation
* Long discussion on our [next gen federation requirements and design document](https://input.scs.community/scs-federation#)
    * Definitions added: IdP, *ID Broker*, SP, Tenant, Tenant root account
        * Tenant root account is the role at the customer who manages the tenant via self-service (as far as we can enable it)
    * Two cases: Tenant-specific IdP (corporate IdP) and global IdP (e.g. "github" / "social login")
    * Social logins via corporate IdP are corporate IdP from SCS IAM perspective
    * Rather than discarding any attributes (e.g. groups) from global IdPs, we could prefix/namespace them to be safe (it's up to the tenant root account to attach authroizations to such attributes)
    * Account provisioning (first login) remains a challenge -- individual invitation links needed?
        * SCIM would help this

----

## Federation - Security

* Avoid exposing the correct guess of a user name by redirecting to the IdP stored for that user
    * This would reduce the number of brute force attempts needed significantly (2*(user+pass) => 2^user * 2^pass)
    * May need tenant specific login screens
        * (Dropdown would expose info, entering as text not user-friendly)
* Secure offboarding helped by SCIM

# Team Ops

Report by <a href="https://github.com/o-otte">@o-otte</a> 

---

## Team Ops

- **SCS2 Environment:** Provisioning of Users and Project has begun. Mailing from PlusServer will follow
- **Operations after Funding:** Open question who will operate SCS related services, e.g. Harbor, Zuul, etc.

## SIG Community

Recap of our EOF (great talks, great food, great community) and collecting the outcomes:

* community discussion (presented last Community Call)
* Building a Project Board (mail by Felix, see below)
* Clean-up of GitHub Repos

---

# SIG Standardization/Certification

Report by <a href="https://github.com/mbuechse">@mbuechse</a>

----

## SIG Standardization/Certification

- how do we understand manual audits?
  - example: Availability Zones
  - mainly specify what kind of documentation we expect to see
  - reserve the right to inspect on premises on short notice
- proposal state for ADRs: necessary?
