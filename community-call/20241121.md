# Team IaaS

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS

Report by @berendt

----

## Team IaaS

* Security Standard ([PR#765](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/765))
* Standard IaaS APIs [scs-0123](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0123-v1-mandatory-and-supported-IaaS-services)
  

---

# Team IAM & Security
Report by @garloff

----

* Short discussion on zuul breakage b/c of overloaded or broken gx-scs
* IAM: Write up [federation v2 ideas from hedgedoc](https://input.scs.community/scs-federation#) into something persistent: ADR / Blog / Whitepaper / Spec / SU article and make it visible in the OpenStack universe (@gtema)
* Security Pipelines: Various improvements
    * Remaining instability seems to be caused by zuul
    * Greenbone Enterprise offer (from Elmar Geese)
        * Can't ship with SCS, obviously
        * Short docs-based assessment on whether it would work with our automation/pipelines

# Team Ops
Report by @o-otte

----

# Team Ops

- **Cluster Stack Assets Creation Automation:** Automation done with `just` for simplifing tasks, enable local users and CI working with the repository
- **Status Page:** Bugs and Problems resolved, new container needs to be build for new deployment

---

# Team Container
Report by @garloff

----

- Stabilizing Network Policies [scs-0219-v1](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0219-v1-kaas-networking)
    - tested via sonobuoy
    - adminNetworkPolicy is a SHOULD (upstream in beta)

- Node distribution [scs-0214-v2](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0214-v2-k8s-node-distribution) does not work as is
    - we don't have `node-id` support from upstream (capX).
    - thus need to live without full test for now.
    - wording on test needs adjustment
        - Perform change and stabilize by the end of the week

# SIG Standards/Certification
Report by @garloff

- [Stabilizing SCS-compatible IaaS v5](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/824)
    - [scs-0123-v1](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0123-v1-mandatory-and-supported-IaaS-services) - mandatory IaaS APIs was stabilized and added since last week
    - v5 will turn effective on 2024-11-22
    - v4 will turn into “warn” status on 2025-01-01
- Progress regarding KaaS certification
    - plugins to create to-be-tested clusters on the fly
        - ClusterStacks (tested on moin), static, and kind exist, Gardener WIP
    - NetworkPolicies standardized [scs-0219-v1](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0219-v1-kaas-networking), test via sonobuoy
    - Last moving part: Node distribution [scs-0214-v2](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0214-v2-k8s-node-distribution) needs to live without full test due to missing `host-id` label support in capX -> adjust test wording and stabilize by end of week
    - ->[KaaS-v1]() early next week
- UNICC wants to adopt SCS standards :rocket:

# Special discussion topic today:
## Future of team / SIG meetings

* We currently have a setup with somewhat specialized meetings around technologies (IaaS, KaaS, Ops Tooling, IAM ...) and cross-cutting areas (Sec, Standards, Doc, Community, ...).
* Expecting fewer meetings in the future (less coordination, maybe a little less contribution also)
* Software development is carried on out of own interest by some of the technology partners (e.g. OSISM, syself)
* Want to ensure that there is a place for coordination and that there are documented, easy-to-find ways to interact and contribute ("open community")
    * Meetings, Office Hours, Chat Sessions, Mailing lists, ...

----

# EOF Project Board Proposal extended

* There is a *project board*, with a forum rep and elected reps from the (github) community: PR [standards/#813](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/813)
    * Governance over github SCS repositories that carry implementation, documentation artifacts. (The Standards repo is under direct control from the Forum SCS-Standards.)

* Extension from EOF:
    * Create and publish an overview over the interaction facilities
    * Identify gaps and trigger their filling
    * Expect volunteers from
        * Technology Partners
        * Forum SCS-Standards Members @ OSBA
        * SAB project @ ALASCA
        * S7n Cloud Services GmbH offers help if wanted
