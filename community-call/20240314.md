# Updates from the Teams

---

# Team IaaS

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

----

# Team IaaS

OVN
- Security Update of OVN in Release 7.0.0d (RC3) is available
- Blog Post by @fkr about the vuln is available here: https://scs.community/security/2024/02/20/cve-2023-3966/

----

# Team IaaS

~~Domain~~ Manager Role
- the "domain-manager" role will be renamed to "manager" to align with upstream
- the role itself is already implemented
- Todo: stabilize the standard (currently in draft)
- if this will be a certification requirement is another discussion

----

# Team IaaS

Keystone Token Security
- there are two implementations: Fernet Tokens and JWS
- Fernet spec is the current default, but apparently unmaintained
- [Issue to evaluate switching to JWS](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/568)

----

# Team IaaS

Classification of SCS-supported OpenStack components and services
- Call to action: if you spot anything "unsupported" in this [list](https://input.scs.community/list-of-required-recommended-and-optional-openstack-projects#) that you need or use please drop a comment in this issue: [SovereignCloudStack/issues#528](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/528)

----

# Team IaaS

Ceph Mon Backups

- needed to recover corrupt mon database especially when using encrypted OSDs
- outline of the backup functionality was presented
- Question: how to integrate this work into OSISM
- Tracking Issue: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/529

----

# Team IaaS

Call to Action: Decision needed how we want to provide Security Group defaults

- Standard would need `network rbac create` - that has severe downsides
- Decision Record: [SovereignCloudStack/standards#495](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/495)
- First Documentation Draft: [SovereignCloudStack/docs#142](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/142)

# Team IAM & Security

Report by @JuanPTM

----

# Team IAM & Security

## Upcoming R6

- Release Notes !!!
- Original Plan vs Our work for R6

----

# Team IAM & Security

## Security

- Automated security testing now in SCS zuul repo
    - Currently in a branch, will be merged soon.

----

# Team IAM & Security

## IAM

- Upstream Patch for Keystone - custom roles for federated users has been merged 
    - Example: Allowing to delegate management capabilities

----

# Team IAM & Security

## Keystone token provider

- Lenghty discussion on token format (**Fernet** vs. **JWS**)
- **JWS** = only signed not encrypted, requires no key replication in Keystone
- **Fernet** = encrypted, persistent and the decyption keys are replicated between Keystone instances
- Stick to the default, follow upstream consent here



---

# Team Ops

We build tooling and infrastructure design for easy, efficient 
and transparent ways to operate an SCS Cloud.

----

# Team Ops 

- Release notes for R6 in preparation
    - Zuul, Status Page, Central API, Observability Cluster, Health Monitor

- Observability for IaaS in R6: OSISM tests observability cluster in k3s cluster (mgmt node)

# Community Member Pages

* We have now linked the [Community Members Page](https://scs.community/members/) on the website under the menu item "Discover SCS".
* Why do we periodically address this topic?
  Improved abilities to communicate, share and discuss is an important factor to increas our success as a community. Especially when a community like ours pursues an exchange of users and the "Open Operations" paradigm.
* Just raise a pull request, as Eduard described that with his [blog article](https://scs.community/2023/01/27/community-profiles/)
* New profile pages are [not indexed by Google](https://scs.community/robots.txt)
