# Any newcomers? Welcome!

# Updates from the Teams

---

# Team IaaS

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

----

# Team IaaS

- No call this week due to OpenInfra Day Berlin

---

# Team IAM & Security - IAM

The Team IAM deals with topics around Identity and Access Management.

Sovereign Cloud Stack has the goal that user identities can used across several layers in the stack (most importantly IaaS and Container layer), that user management should be a self-service capability and that user identities can be federated.

Authentication and Authorization are important topics for the security of a platform. We deal with those here, but currently also the broader topics around security / penetration testing.

----

# Team IAM & Security - IAM / Security

- No call this week due to OpenInfra days

- Work in progress ([PR #70](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/pull/70))
- CAPO handles CRD version migration automatically

----

# Team Container
## Standards
