# Team IAM & Security

Report by <a href="https://github.com/juanptm">@JuanPTM</a>

----

## Team IAM & Security

- Research on Keycloak Social Login
    - Different approach on how to solve it

----

## Team IAM & Security

- Turnkey Solution / Documentation

Report by <a href="https://github.com/mbuechse">@mbuechse</a>

----

## SIG Standardization/Certification

- Finalizing SCS-compatible IaaS v5
    - postponed until November
      (we expect many standards to become stable by then, and it represents more or less the standardization achievements in the funded SCS project)
- Stabilizing SCS-compatible KaaS v1
    - some technical matters have to be resolved still
      (speed of patching, host-id labels, anti-affinity)
- CNCF conformance
    - discussed technical matters regarding provisioning of test cluster
- Release notes R7
