# Team IAM

----

# Team IAM
## Most important item to share with the group that was discussed?

- Creation of Keycloak container
    - Creation of container-images repo in SCS
    - Daily rebuilds possible

----

# Team IAM
## Anything else relevant news?

* Progress update on several issues 
    - Upstream patch to keystone

* Domain Manager update
    - Draft is almost done 

----

# Team IAM
## The security reporting process

* Needed a way to report (potentially) sensitive information to a very limited circle at first
* Chose github security advisory process:
    * Only visible to project owners and reporter
    * Plus anyone that is added explicitly
    * Can be opened completely later-on
* Security contact (email) security@scs.community remains valid

---

# Team Ops

We build tooling and infrastructure design for easy, efficient and transparent ways to operate an SCS Cloud.

----

# Team Ops

* Status Page Deployment can be merged to main soon, afterwards to be tested also by @berendt
* Zuul User Documentation merged and available
    
    * New issue template for onboarding Repositories to Zuul


----

# Team Ops
## Any important decisions that are going to be taken?

* Refine Zuul Epics to separate them into "Deployment", "Use of it", and "Stability Improvements"


---

# SIG Documentation

* new distinction of docs for operators (primary) and devs (secondary)
* ciab and testbed docs have been reworked
* distinction between "bare metal" and "cloud resources" use cases within iaas deployment examples

---

# SIG Standardization & Certification

* The combination of a certification level (SCS-compatible/open/sovereign) and a cloud layer (IaaS/Container) is called a "certificate scope" now (rather than certificate type or certificate subject)
* Better distinction between ADRs and Standards based on ADR-specific template
* Description and structure for docs page are WIP [#76](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/76)
* KaaS and IaaS specific preparational meetings to prioritize long backlog of standardization topics
