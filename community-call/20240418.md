# Team IAM & Security - Roles

Finalizing domain-scoped manager role definition:
* Standard [scs-0302](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0302-v1-domain-manager-role.md), PR [#384](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/384), Docs PR [#178](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/178)
* How to test?
    * Is implemented in SCS-R6 (OSISM 7.0.x)
    * Tests can be done with testbed and CiaB
    * Testcases wanted
* Local domain management capability replaced by IdP if federation is used
* Stabilize (once we have it merged upstream or are confident with it happening)

----

# Team IAM & Security - IAM

* Progress with documentation [#595](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/595), [#596](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/596), [#597](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/597)
* Big topic: Alignment of [hackathon discussion outcomes](https://input.scs.community/C6OKMb4xQQuqnHC6axv08g#) on Mon, 2024-04-22, 16:05 CEST (SCS-Tech)
    * 1:1 relationship keystone domain - SCS-keycloak realm
    * Optional external (customer) IdP only holds users and `scs-` groups, no role assignments
        * SCS-keycloak does not assign groups to users (exceptions possible for `scs-local-` groups)
    * SCS-keycloak assigns roles to groups (and to users, which can be disabled, especially if external IdP is used)
        * This is our "mapping engine"
        * Self-Service capability (within realm)
        * Role assignements in SCS-keycloak have the form "group `scs-G` has `manager/member/reader` rights in project `UUID`"
    * SCS-keycloak enforces no external admins (except  for privileged internal IdP) and realm isolation
* Building a PoC needed

# Team IAM & Security - Security

* Progress on adding security scanners [#526](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/526) into CI pipeline [#537](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/537)
    * Configuration of weekly jobs
* Lightning talk planned 

---

# Team Ops

We build tooling and infrastructure design for easy, efficient 
and transparent ways to operate an SCS Cloud.

----

# Team Ops 

* **OVN Exporter:** Work continues, will be resolved in about 2 weeks
* **Central API:**

    * Good results from the Hackathon, Using Central API to deploy OpenStack Resources, Kubernetes Resources, and leverage ClusterStacks works
    * Hackathon feedback will be topic of next SIG meeting
* **Status Page Development:** Minor integration test needed for the deployment, then Technical Preview is ready to be tested, Lightning talk at the end of the call

# Team Container

We're building a streamlined platform that simplifies the management of Kubernetes clusters on various providers.

----

# Team Container

* Hackathon summary:
    * Knowledge about Cluster Stacks was spread

----

# Team Container

* Cluster Stacks updates:
    * `cluster.spec.topology.version` can be used for upgrading node image k8s patch versions
        * How to deal with new patch versions - CSO webhook
    * CSPO supports custom CA and also `verify: false` setting [cluster-stack-provider-openstack#148](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-provider-openstack/pull/148)

----

# Team Container

* Standardization:
    * KaaS Gitops/CI tooling [issues#420](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/420)
        * GitOps to manage k8s clusters
    * KaaS Logging/Monitoring/Tracing [issues#418](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/418)
        * Will be presented on Ops meeting

----

# Team Container

* SCS Registry upgrade:
    * latest KaaS R6
    * latest Harbor v2.10.2
    * Image pushing issue was resolved

# SIG Standardization/Certification

Report by @martinmo

----

- Where do we document efforts and guidelines of making OpenStack environments not created with the reference impl scs-compatible (especially Yaook)?
  - General guidelines:
    - implementation notes for the standards
    - guide in the IaaS docs at docs.scs.community
  - Yaook specifics: blog post
- Effort was very valuable: feedback and improvements for our standards and conformance tests

----

- Discussion about v2 of node distribution standard (KaaS track scs-0214)
  - stop-gap measure needed because reference impl doesn't provide the new labels yet: OpenStack specific test
  - failure zones are not well defined in the standard
  - edge cases, e.g., shared control planes, are not covered (Gardener)

---

# Adoption
* Looking forward to talk more about ByCS (Bayern Cloud Schule)
* Looking forward for ScaleUp offerings
* May 24: Linux-Magazin 6/24 (DE publication) with SCS focus
    * Will be avail May 3
    * We'll have free copies for our summit
