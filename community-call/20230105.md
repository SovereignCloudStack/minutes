# SCS Tech Weekly 2023-01-05

## Meta

- Minutes: Jonas

## Team updates

Nothing happened because we had no team calls this week.

## AOB

### Meeting structure changes

## Project Updates

**NB:** This section will only contain the minutes on things which are not explicitly mentioned in the corresponding slides. In addition, things which are being repeated (such as job offers) in meetings will may not be repeated in the minutes.

### Standardisation

- Keep standard relevant documents separate from other documents
- Need to take care of pending PRs first, in order to not break during the split of the docs repository

### Community

- PlusServer environment (gx-scs) fully back and available
- Operate First Meetup meets Open Operations: https://youtube.com/watch?v=f9KeWmy52ik

#### Change to team call structure

- Previously: the PO did the PO work and the moderation/facilitation of the meeting
- Next: one PO does the PO work, another PO does the moderation/facilitation
- Concretely:

  - Container: Kurt PO, Felix facilitation
  - IaaS/IAM: Felix PO, Kurt facilitation

- Want to spend more time on proper backlog grooming -> partners will be nugded to make sure that the backlog is always ready to be pulled from

#### Changes to timeslots

- SIG Market: weekly on Thursdays, 11:05 -- 11:35 Europe/Berlin
- Open Operations WG: monthly on Monday, 15:05 -- 15:55 Europe Berlin

  That leaves us with approximately two overflow slots per month (the other one being taken by the lean operator coffee). Exact cadence will be published later.

#### Community Summit

- Will take place on 23rd + 24th of May in Berlin.
- Location will be figured out.
- Registration at https://events.scs.community/scs-summit-2023/

#### OpenInfra foundation elections

- Individual director election happening next week, make sure to cast your vote
