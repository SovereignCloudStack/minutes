# Updates from the Teams

# Team IaaS

We build the reference implementation of the IaaS parts of SCS that informs and adheres to the SCS IaaS standards.

----

# Team IaaS

* no team meeting next week, vPTG week (https://ptg.opendev.org/ptg.html) & vacation time
* new team Matrix room: #scs-iaas:matrix.org (not yet listed in the SCS space)

----

# Team IaaS

* Leaderless projects in OpenInfra after PTL elections will be declared as technical preview (b/c we have doubts on the maturity of those projects)
* Work on the domain admin role is on going, we'll probably evaluate keystone-keycloak-backend by Vexxhost as an alternative approach to interact with Keycloak
* Probably the RabbitMQ defaults will change in the future (proposals are being prepared)
* We're working on confidential computing (again)

----

# Team IaaS / Networking (VP04)

* Onboarding of dNation & Daiteap done, welcome to SCS
* topics for the next months
    * Encrypt all the traffic (east, west, north, south)
    * Inter-Cloud communication (encrypted, of course)
    * Switching/Routing offloading (e.g. to SONiC switches) (lab build with real hardware initiated to start the work on our own SONiC Community image)
        * Edgecore: 7726-32X (100G), 7326-56X (25G), 5835-54X (10G), 4630-54TE (1G)

# ITZB tender

* 410M€ tender from ITZ Bund (data center from the German federal government) for 5yrs of an open source managed on-prem cloud: https://www.service.bund.de/IMPORTE/Ausschreibungen/eVergabe/539333.html?type=0&type=0
* Open till Nov 1, last questions till Oct 20.
* Please talk to SCS project leadership if you are participating with an SCS based offering and want to ensure that we can back things that you plan to do
* "Open Source based" wanted, but no strong criteria unfortunately (clarified by question), so we don't hold our breath for this being a win for an SCS provider.
