- Reference implementation
  - Support for diskless OpenStack flavors - PR has been created
  - Discussions about automated CI testing and dependencies auto-updates (renovatebot), Jan'll create an issue for that
  - dNation together with SCS team will take care of upgrades of KaaS dependencies (calico, kind, flux etc.)
  - CNI - default CNI solution for KaaS will be Cilium - PR is ready for review
  - dNation will be responsible for backporting bug fixes into stable branches: `maintained/v5.x` and `maintained/v5.0.x`, Syself takes over once the Cluster Stack takes place
- Standards
  - CNI-related ADR starts this week
  - Syself will take care of the presentation about Cilium (next weekly)
- Central API mini-hackathon organized by folks from Gonicus will take place 18th of July

### Team IaaS

- Separate image definitions from code (openstack-image-manager)
  - Good idea, go for it
- OpenStack Powered Trademark Tests
  - Investment highly desirable from SCS perspective
  - Currently, no capacity to address these things, work could be done as a part of VP01 & VP10-3
- Bump up recommended images
  - CentOS 8 - EOL since 2021
    - Decision: Deprecate CentOS8 and make AlmaX (X=Latest) a recommended image
- Test script regarding scs-0101-entropy
  - Script done
  - Integrate script into Zuul CI pipeline to test reference implementation
- Zuul
  - Will replace GitHub actions
  - There will be a central zuul instance to talk to

### Team Ops

- OpenInfra Compliance Checks
  - Migration from GitHub Action to Zool is planned
  - Tenant credentials
    - Zuul uses a key pair, and we encrypt our secrets with this key pair 
    and put them into the repo
- Zuul - further discussions on various zuul related topics
  - Certificate expiration for https://zuul.scs.community - will be renewed manually
  - How to create the compliance check table? - Badgets will be assigned based on the Zuull result files
- Status Page
  - API is mostly implemented, just some minor issues (OpenAPI) left
- Container Layer Survey Results
  - Results have been collected
  - ADR will be written based on that
              
### Team IAM

- Mid-Sprint review
- OS_* environment vs. containerized openstackclient 
  - `clouds.yaml/secure.yaml` and `--os-cloud=` are preferred 
- ADRs
  - IdP features - PR merged
  - Roles - issue
- Adding realms requires container restarts 
  - related logout issue with proxy realms - almost done 
- SHA256 usage instead of plain code exchange - PR
- PlusServer domain/groups/projects/roles creation recommendations
  - meeting notes will be published
- device authorization workflow 
  - not blocking - waiting for reviewathon
- IdP control of cluster-admin access
  - oidc parameters are set on API server, k8s script adjusted
  - team is addressing testbed network issues 

### IAM Hack session
- Domain admin role secure?
  - Admin rights can be scoped to domains or projects, but that is not enforced by OpenStack
  - Members are properly limited to the scope of their project/domain
  - Conclusion: Admin permissions can not be granted to customers with the current state of our implementation
    - Is this a configuration issue? or something else? -> will be discussed, team is looking for a solution
