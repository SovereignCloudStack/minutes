## Agenda

### OpenCoDE https://opencode.de/

* Platform for public employees to share and develop OSS code
* opentalk example: they mirror code from public gitlab to opencode
  - mirrroring can also create confusion, so it may not be an obvious win
  - would also be a git backup (we have one gitea at OSISM for OSISM (not SCS though) already)
    - https://gitea.services.osism.tech/
    - --> Helm chart: https://github.com/osism/public-services/tree/main/sto1/gitea
    - --> Docs: https://github.com/osism/public-services#gitea-service
    - --> Mirror script: https://github.com/osism/public-services/blob/main/scripts/mirror.py
  - would need to be read-only to avoid PR/merge reconciliation challenges
  - would need agreement from opencode policy makers
  => @itrich to clarify questions and move forward with it

### DVS Rahmenwerk Zielarchitektur requires WAF

* We don't have this as part of SCS
* To be integrated into administrative networks, this will need to be implemented
* Question: Should we have this as part of SCS architecture and ref.impl.?
  -> evaluate what others have done (e.g. Wavecon) and see whether there is common solution to this requirement (AI @frosty-geek add requirement to backlog)

### ALASCA Blog -> Standardization focus

* scs-compliance-check.py (see Docs PR#182: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/pull/182)
* Add OpenStack Powered Compute 2021.11 requirement (without test case?) YES
