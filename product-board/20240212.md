## Agenda

### RelEngR6:

* for OSISM: we fixed all known issues in 7.0.0a

#### Big ticket items:
* Central API
    * as discussed in [SIG Central API](https://input.scs.community/2024-scs-sig-central-api?both#Upcoming-Release), we are optimistic to have at least a technical preview
* Any artefacts missing from Team IaaS that are required by other teams?
* RC testing going along? Any reports?
* ClusterStacks
    * not yet in a state to be called RC
* Observability (@bitkeks)
    * Monitoring of infra is ready and in use
    * We can look into making the (currently marked as Tech Preview) observability cluster for IaaS and KaaS an RC
    * Especially the IaaS observability feature should be beneficial during RC testing, so the observability stack is tested as well

## OVS Security Issue?

- Updated images are available
- Advisory will be published throughout this week
