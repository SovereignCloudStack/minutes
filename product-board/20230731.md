## Agenda

### Transition to diskless flavors: What's left?
* Done: v3 flavor std (flavors with disk only recommended, except the two SSD flavors)
* Done: openstack health mon
* Done: k8s-capi-provider
* ToDo: Announce strategy to community and document usage (e.g. `openstack server create --block-device` )
    * Blog article (ToDo: @garloff), Lightning Talk

### SIG release: Thu 14:05 (bi-weekly if no SIG std/cert)?
* Yes

### Team meet dates need reshuffling
* IAM needs both Univention and Gonicus, Univ can not do 10:30, Gonicus not 11:30. Switch with Ops? Gaia-X OSS conflict Thu 9:00.
* Container not good for C&H (bi-weekly conflict)
* Proposal: Wed 10:05 IaaS, 11:35 IAM, Thu 9:05 Ops, 10:35 Container
    * OK for PB participants, post to tech list next (@garloff)

### Registry for Eclipse XFSC
* No short-term solution from EF
* Supporting our friends @ XFSC always desirable
    * BMWK wants us to collaborate
    * cross-pollination SCS <-> XFSC users
        * Put some SCS branding on our registry
* ... but ...
    * registry.scs.community not highly available (OK for XFSC)
    * no long-term solution (unless PS wants to long-term sponsor this, then maybe do some publicity?)
    * XFSC repos are not well maintained currently (some not maintained at all), thus may not necessarily leave a good impression
        * Disclaimer: Varying quality, not artifacts from SCS, not all meant for production
        * Community around XFSC projects still needs to emerge
        * Sep 5/6 in Berlin: GXFS connect (@FriederikeZelke on a panel), FZ to report learnings, https://www.gxfs.eu/gxfs-connect-2023/
        * Fri (2023-08-04) panel with @batistein
        * XFSC not easily deployable (Code exists, no registry, no CI, ...) and original developers have partially vanished. Migration still ongoing. Afterwards making it deployable is the job for syself.
* Long term: EF should build SCS infra WITH registry
    * @berendt has pinged @mplagge already, no reponse yet, AI @batistein to talk Cristina Pauna, Kurt to @mplagge
