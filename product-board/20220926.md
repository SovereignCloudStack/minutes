## Agenda
Need workshop on how to secure contribution (€€€ or contributions or best both and public references) from ecosystem players that benefit massively from SCS' (and OSISM's) work.
We need to motivate good behavior from downstream consumers / service vendors:

* By license?
* By certification/brand?
* By publicity ... ?
* ... how else?
