## Agenda

### [OSISM v5.1.0 release](https://release.osism.tech/notes/5.1.0.html)
* Resolves [osism/issues/#490](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/490) - OVN: FIP connection problem with FIPs and FIPs and `neutron_ovn_distributed_fip=true` 
* Also documents solution to [osism/issues/#428](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/428) - OvS: Ubu22.04 needs iptables nft compat or better switching to openvswitch firewall_driver 
* Really good work from all parties involved (OSISM, PlusServer, SCS, ...)
* Blueprint how to resolve issues and do (minor) releases
* Should talk about it: Blog-Posting?
    * YES: Talk about 5.1.0 and how it was done (and how we generally plan to do this) (@garloff, @neuroserve, @friederike)
    * PlusServer Blogpost w.r.t update journey planned anyway, WIP (PR already open) (@frosty-geek)
* Open issues for a 5.2.0 required soon ... ? #494, #495?
    * Nothing visible right now (of course we will need to look at ceph Quincy in May)

### CVE-2023-1668
https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/06/1
* OpenVSwitch issue with IP proto 0, affecting MANY versions, leading to DoS
* Patches published
* Resolved in OvS-3.1.1 and thus in OSISM-v5.1.0
* Separate Advisory (Blog) or include in 5.1.0 announcement?
    * Separate (AI @garloff, @osfrickler)
* Releasing v4.3.0?
    * Will be needed, @berendt to drive, waiting for Ubu cloud-archive packages

### Learning from prior release
* release was scheduled for 22nd march
* updating a non-productive environment only two weeks prior to release is too short (for ... ?)
* pre-release 4 - 6 weeks prior to release would be better
    * -> Start testing by early August (earlier is better)
    * -> weekly snapshots could serve the purpose
        * They have a date-based name
        * Need visibility which versions are deployed and tested
* plusserver had some issues

### R5 planning
Outcomes from IaaS and Container Teams:

* SCS is standardized
* SCS is understandable
* SCS is continuously built and tested
* SCS is opinionated
* SCS enables
* SCS is transparent

Outcomes from IAM mini-hackathon:

### k3s on management plane

* Management plane will move from single-node to multi-node (optional) to enable HA
* k8s (with likely k3 as technology to create cluster)
* opt-in for new services
    * Main target is new services (add-on)
    * Migrate services from docker-compose to k8s as soon as the new model becomes pervasive
    * An HA IAM (keycloak) will likely be one of the first candidates for this
        * Clustered postgresql will need to be done
* To avoid keycloak being blocked in dev, we can use another k8s cluster (e.g. capi) short-term
* AI: @garloff (IAM) -> @fkr (IaaS)
