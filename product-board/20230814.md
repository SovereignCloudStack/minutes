## Agenda

### R5 release - 2023-09-20
* Ask in team meets for more input
* Ensure features get completed
* First RC - End of Aug/Beg of Sep
    * PS preoccupied with scaling up production, may not be able to follow RCs as closely as last time
    * More CSPs wanted to deploy RCs: wave, regio, artcodix, aov, dataport (AI @garloff)

### Hashicorp's SBL/SBuL
* No longer under OSI compliant license
* Effects on SCS
    * vault and terraform are being used
    * can not ship SBL licensed code
    * Short-term: Stick to old versions
    * Medium-term: Fork or rip-out
        * terraform fork already exists ...
        * vault usage in OSISM needs investigation
* Blog article?
    * Document that we don't ship new versions (under SBL)
    * OSS health-check had this on the radar
    *  Move away from hashicorp's SW
        * Forks or rip-out
    * Advise to be careful
        * k8s-capi to potentially replace terraform automation
    * @garloff to write Blog
        * Followup by @batistein on k8s-capi replacing tf

### Sec blog article on CPU vulns and patching
* Theory: Kurt + @bitkeks (Dominik Pataky)
* Looking for an Operator: Deployment of fixes
    * @frosty-geek checks whether they can supply these parts

### PenTesters onboarded
* Will analyze SCS for weaknesses (both black- and whitebox testing)
* Responsible disclosure
* Will also help us to improve security and build CI security tests
    * https://mineryreport.com/
* What environments should they attack? Notfication protocol?
    * Test against testbed / private k8s-cluster
    * Test against SCS project hardware (VP18) environments

### Preview for R5 standards
* Wanted: "diff" against R4 standards
* Create preview for planned changes to scs-compatible.yaml (@garloff)
