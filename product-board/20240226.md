## Agenda

### HA for VMs (@fkr)
- Especially good timing (wrt vmware/broadcom)
- Where and how to evaluate Masakari properly
    - SCS Lab environment
    - Testbed may not work (stonith hard to do ...)
    - PS test env
    - PS had started looking at Masakari w/o final conclusion
    - Process outside of OpenStack is an option (but not preferrable)
        - Should still be shared amongst SCS operators
    - It will be opt-in for customers

### R6 release process, testing, status (@garloff)
- 7.0.0b (RC1) released on Wed eve
- Some issues found
- Feedback from @maliblatt
- ceph-ansible update with an issue (missing key)
- SCS1 (gx-scs) may not be updatable b/f the release date, atm working hard to hold that timeline as discussed
- Need to get other providers to contribute more testing
- PS likely needs until mid May to go to R6
- A good upgrade process (e.g. with predictable outage of API ...) helps

### KaaS in R6 (@jschoone)
- v1 reference implementation
    - as expected we'll keep it until R7
        - does not require much effort
        - for running environments, we won't recommend new installations on this
    - will even have release notes because we had some notable features
    - this allows existing users more time to migrate over to v2 (migration path R5 v1 -> R6 v1 -> R6 v2)
    - v2 (ClusterStacks) will be the focus of our communication

### IaaS-v4 standards (@garloff)
- See mail from @mbuechse last Friday
- Stabilize [scs-0104-v1](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0104-v1-standard-images) Standard Images (PR [#464](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/464))

### KaaS-v1 lacks compliance tests (@garloff)
- [scs-0210-v2](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0210-v2-k8s-version-policy) k8s version policy: Tests are KaaS implementation dependent (we look at cluster lifecycle properties as opposed to the k8s things)
- [scs-0214-v1](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0214-v1-k8s-node-distribution) k8s node distribution: Same
- Suggested approach:
    - Implement tests that work for our reference implementation (and possibly solutions that are technologically similar enough)
    - Require others that want to certify to contribute tests for their KaaS implementation
        - Just a plugin to create the cluster for the test (and the cleanup later on)
        - @frosty-geek will look into a plugin for PSKE, looking for other Gardener users to collaborate
    - Static properties could be retrieved from an existing / running cluster / pod
- Short-term:
    - Accept KaaS-v1 without full test coverage?
    - Implement short-term (for v1 or v2)!
        - Martin working on it

### Hackathon #4 @ Gonicus 2024-04-16 (@garloff/@fkr)
- Any input for the planners from here?
- 3 -- 4 rooms, some topics prepared by POs
- HedgeDoc for more input to be created (@fkr)
