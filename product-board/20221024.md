## Agenda

### PTG Review

* octavia
  * https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/antelope-ptg-octavia
  * Contribution by SCS / SCS community highly welcome, especially reviews!
  * Target our Operators when relevant topics are discussed and changes need review/testing/...
  - Logshipping
  * SCS PO / OSISM to invest time to monitor and contribute
* RBAC tc
  * (Need more input from @reqate / @matfechner)
  * Scoping of roles in OpenStack ("manager" role in work / clean domain admin role)
- Timeline looks like this will take until 2024
- Contributions very welcome -- would help to speed this up
- Needs investment by SCS

* Learning: Reserve the PTG week next time!

### SGX enablement (OSISM)
  * Pre-existing work from intel/99cloud should be reviewed/merged

### IAM leverage during R4
* wavecon and plusserver both using their own approach to user management
  * no keycloak
* OSISM not using keycloak either - typically keystone connected to LDAP
* Architecture with ID broker may still be valid; implementation using keycloak not popular currently
  * keystone is too limited: only supports one IdP *per domain*; enablement needs keystone restart, config file tweaks, ...
* Policies & Roles may be a prerequisite to make federation really useful
  * Needed to have roles with limited administrative power that are standardized and reviewed/audited

* Architecture likely still valid -> let's document and discuss it in ADRs
* Technology evaluation needs to be done
