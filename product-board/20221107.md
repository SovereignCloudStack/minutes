## Agenda

### Participation
- Dirk, @manuela-urban optional

### Aftermath of SpookySSL (openSSL-3 x.509 mail parser vuln, CVE-2022-3602)
* Advisory out (2022-11-01)
* Update needed?
    - OSISM v4.1.0?
    	* Testbed repaired, zuul passed upgrade tests
    	* openstack-image-manager images updated, are now updated automatically weekly
    	  (debian, ubuntu, rocky, alma, centos, ...), EOL images removed
    	* add new section with updated information to advisory
    	* create issue to track this
    - Others?
    	* Keep eyes open for severe sec issues ahead

### How to get Image Metadata spec implemented by SCS operators
* Spec in place since >1yr :-)
* Conformance test implemented mid Sep 2022, found WaveStack & PCO not conforming :-(
* Goal was set to implement conformance by 2022-10-31 (change is non-disruptive ...)
* Not achieved :-(
* Technical approach to achieve conformance was to handle metadata in image-manager (OSISM/innovex)
    - agreement
* Image-manager will be ready for this by January 2023
    - Communication failure, deadline 'till 2022-10-31 was not understood?
    - Reasoning for January estimate is many other features are also pending ....
* Decision needed:
    [ ] Wait with conformance requirement 'till 2023-01-31
    [x] Speed up image-manager development
    [ ] Ask providers to add metadata with separate script short-term (2022-11-30?) <= Not supported by PlusServer

Resolution:
* Scope for image-manager: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/168
    - Will contain the SCS spec compliant meta-data

    -> Will be done by 2022-11-23 (except for image-crawler, although possibly superceded by work from last weekend) -> Tentative: Spec effective 2022-12-15

* Larger scope for image-manager till January
