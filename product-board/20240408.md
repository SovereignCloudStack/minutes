## Agenda

### R7 outcomes (@fkr, @garloff)

* SCS is a (well-integrated) turnkey solution
    * deployment of KaaS with IaaS (w/ opt-out)?
        * including registry, monitoring, ...
    * tuning guides / HW blueprints
    * metering and status page integration
    * monitoring integration (-> k3s)
    * Central API (see below)
    * Easy deployment of applications
* SCS is operated at scale => will need input from PS
    * scalable networking (VP04)
    * separation & scalability of storage (VP03)
    * rabbitmq robustness
    * automation and minimal / predictable downtimes on upgrade
    * growth/extending environments without downtimes
    * resource-efficient cluster control-plane (kamaji)
    * defaulting to ovn LB (for L4, e.g. capi)
* ~~SCS serves a variety of workloads /~~ ~~SCS enables modernenterprise workloads~~
* SCS enables diverse workloads
    * ARM64 (aarch64) compute hosts
    * RHEL compute hosts (SAP, Win, ...)
    * VM-HA (opt-in) for VMware
    * GPU/AI enablement
* SCS is federated
    * Finalize role model (with domain manager persona and self-service capabilities) and IaaS federation
    * IAM federation across layers (cover KaaS)
* SCS is continuously robust and secure
    * CI coverage
    * Static Sec analysis in (zuul) pipeline - continuous security
    * Pentesting in pipeline
    * Encryption (TLS, ovn, storage encryption at rest, ...)
* SCS is up-to-date w/ latest proven technologies
    * OpenStack Caracal (2024.01)
    * ceph Reef (w/ rook)
    * Ubu 24.04 LTS
    * Latest k8s
    * Latest capi+capo
    * k3s + keycloak/nubus

#### Central-API outcomes for R7 (@fkr)
* focus needed to get something valuable
    * Topic in flow, diverse requirements
    * End user perspective matters!
    * Possible for operators to only support part of it (e.g. KaaS-only, abstracting away the difference b/w Gardener and capi/capo)
    * Ideal scenario: Support all of the SCS services (IaaS, KaaS, IAM, Mon, ...) and use as the backend for the GUI (Web-Interface)
    * -> Hackathon topic
* openAPI specs for OpenStack (-> Crossplane via kube-api?)
    * maybe past R7
* automating customer onboarding
* opentofu provider? pulumi? ... ?
    * CLI tooling
