## Agenda

### Clevis & Tang deprecated possibly upcoming? (@fkr - ~5min)
- Disk encryption (data at rest)
- Blog article: https://scs.community/2022/08/17/osism-nbde-install/
- Not in use anywhere?
- OSISM thus wants to deprecate it
    - Reasonable
- Wavestack plans to use it?
    - We have too little feedback from Wavestack to base future investment on it
    - @fkr to ping @matfechenr and @cedegi

### Product Brief(s) (@fkr - ~5min)
- email 12.12. Product brief for SCS-IaaS-RI (2 pager)
    - Has gone out to dataport
    - Everyone should have read it
    - Present it in early January to ensure everyone in the team knows how to explain SCS (IaaS RI) using the same language
- Do the same for KaaS RI (based on expected R6 product)
    - AI @jschoone (support from @alexander-diab)
- Then Standards for IaaS and KaaS

### First feedback new team IaaS approach? (~2mins)
- Worked much better than before
- More focus, more interactive
- Positive feedback from team
- Better preparation is one of the main advantages
- Also hoping for more feedback from operators and integrator via open door apptmt

### R6 outcomes... (see 2023-12-04)
- Status: Blog post in preparation (@fkr), input from @jschoone on KaaS will be integrated
- PR exists (as draft), will be undrafted

### Standardization (joint w/ Alasca)
- C&H wants to put much more resources into this
- Also making yaook based infra SCS Compatible out-of-the-box
- Gaining traction for SCS standards in Alasca ecosystem (Syseleven, Secunet, StackIT, elevait, ... )

### Standards compliance
- v3 IaaS will fail on PCO
    - Will become visible sooner or later
- v4 IaaS needs more contents
    - Entropy should be part of it, but currently is not
    - More ...
    - Original idea was to have it in Dec 2023
    - New timeline?
- v1 KaaS no later than R6 RC phase
