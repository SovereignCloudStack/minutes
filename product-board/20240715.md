## Agenda

### Release plan and deliverables ready4test (@garloff, @bitkeks)
- We are currently in the release candidate phase

    - Create RCs for SCS *components* to facilitate testing
    - Fully integrated turnkey solution will be available with later RCs
    - Need to communicate: What should be tested when (and how much change is still expected after the testing)? -> Blog-Post
- OSISM: latest manager, need to change tags to get ceph reef and openstack 2024.1 (instead of 2023.2)
    - https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/1073
    - No additional tagging needed, stable branches are pretty static
    - Formal tagged release candidates starting ~4 weeks ahead of release

    - Available via switch (opt-in)
        - rookify (migration) is still WIP
