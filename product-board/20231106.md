## Agenda

### R6 Release Cycle Countdown (@fkr)
* Release Notes exist (thanks @fkr)
* Per layer release manager suggested
    * Per Team? Container, Ops, IaaS
    * Proposal of structure @fkr, assign to tender contract winners
* Desired: First RC 6 weeks ahead of release
    * May need to push out the Sept date (R7) a bit
    * Keep 2nd half of March for R6 to avoid Easter conflict
* Can we get firm testing commitments?
    * Talk to providers, express expectation
    * Make this a requirement for certification?
    * Test-board that makes testing contributions visible
        * Both IaaS and KaaS (and other pieces)
        * Focus on companies that do or want to use this in production (which will overlap with certified environments)
* ToDo: Announce dates for R6 and R6 RCs on 2023-11-20

### Release topics:
* Large scale and reliable ops (HA, e.g. rabbitmq, speed of upgrade, ...)
    * Not enough feedback from Operators in general (small and large scale)
* Accelerators (SR-IOV, GPU pass-through, ...)
    * We need to understand specific needs, so we can prepare (e.g. buy hardware) to test
* Convergence w/ ALASCA wanted
    * Standardization is underway
    * Do this pragmatically where it makes sense also in the Reference Implementation

### Confidential Computing (continued) (@fkr)
* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/pull/773
* SEV is already there. Knowledge/Experience is missing?

### OpenStack related bits

#### Re-cap Public Cloud SIG vPTG (@fkr)
* Public cloud SIG, flavor discoverability was discussed, summary will be coming (@fkr) - nova approaches it from the capa mgmt side, not so much from user side (PO role / user perspective missing in OpenStack)

#### Future of OpenStack Interop

* Maybe related to the Public Cloud SIG?
* https://lists.openstack.org/archives/list/openstack-discuss@lists.openstack.org/message/Q4OS2JXADLFG4YK75NH2QORZZRFINUKL/
* https://superuser.openinfra.dev/articles/new-view-on-interoperability-in-openstack/
* To Do: Offer help - which will likely result in us having to take over
    * Talk to Martin Kopec
    * Mgmt side -> SCS
    * Tech work -> VP01

### Cluster Stacks (SCS KaaS v2) on SCS IaaS timeline
* Greenfield (new deployments) vs. brownfield (migration from v1 KaaS)
    * syself currently documenting how implement a provider
        * Hackathon session on this
    * OpenStack provider will be started next
        * May need to move some features from scripts into capo and/or OCCM
        * Goal is mid December
    * Then migration v1 -> v2 (mid January)
        * Migration from v1 to cluster classes already done
    * Testing: artcodix (greenfield), aov, stackXperts (brownfield), syself (for eco :-) )

### Zuul for SCS
* VP06d tender contract holder responsible to run it (at least until we hand we it over)

### SBOM for SCS
* Need this for the ITZB tender and govstack project
* Goal is to have a v1 by the end of this week
    * SPDX headers (SPDX-license-identifier:) wanted everywhere
    * LICENSE files wanted
