## Agenda

### KaaS standards discussion

- Interfaces well defined by k8s
    - Including discoverability for features
- Not so much: System behavior
    - Persistent volumes (CSI)
        - Availability (Do they survive a node crash?)
        - Encryption, ....
    - Networking (CNI)
        - Network policies not available everywhere
        - Flannel (no policies :-( ) vs. Cilium (nw policy + cilium specific extensions) vs. Calico (nw policy + calico specific extensions)
            - Common set useful? => Container team meeting
    - Security baseline
- SCS-compatible KaaS v1 not yet stable
    - Prioritize things that help users/developers

### On the road to R7

#### Status testing and documentation

##### IaaS

- OpenStack 2024.1 testing: https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/1073
    - CI in preparation (Deb, Ubu24.04, ...)
    - Testing by stackXperts, PS
        - magnum CAPI vexxhost
            - sqlalchemy issue relevant?
        - neutron ovn VPNaaS
    - upgrade test:
        - New secret in designate -> documented
        - skyline pwd
        - memcached horizon (no action needed)
- TBD: Space from ubuntu-capi images in image manager will be removed (https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/pull/823)
- OSISM 8.0.0 release: https://github.com/osism/release/issues/1540 (8.0.0-rc.1 done)
    - testbed will test this soon
- OSISM 8.0.0 release notes: https://github.com/osism/osism.github.io/pull/671
- VP04 (securing the network) results
    - Will reach OSISM via upstream
    - To Do: Check what has already landed in OSISM 8 and what is yet to come
- Storage/ceph:
    - Quincy is still default (ceph-ansible)
    - Reef is available (ceph-ansible)
    - Tech Preview: can use rook
    - ceph-ansible ----> rook migration (with rookify) not yet ready (https://github.com/sovereigncloudstack/rookify)

##### Cluster stacks

- Main issue is divergence of clouds
    - Missing LB (yaook)
    - Jump-Host in the way
- Documentation work

##### IAM

- keycloak moved from docker to k3s
    - documentation missing (AI @garloff: double check)
    - https://osism.tech/de/docs/guides/concept-guide/components/keycloak
    - https://osism.tech/de/docs/guides/concept-guide/components/k3s
- domain manager -> should be in R8 (from upstream)
    - spec merged upstream, implementation not yet

##### Security pipeline

- test and blog post pending

##### Monitoring

- test and blog post

##### Standards

- no requirements to ref. impl. beyond the space in image manager

#### What to do with contributions pending upstream merge?

- Try to push as long as we can
- Hope that it's pursued afterwards in case that failed

#### Release notes

- PR: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/pull/27>
- Needs a lot of work
- Best path to become part of [press release](https://input.scs.community/bKv0NIG0QymKEOas5AQibg#)
- Otherwise per mail to @garloff or to @FriederikeZelke
- OSISM/IaaS highlights: OpenStack 2024.1, Ubuntu 24.04/Debian 12/CentOS Stream 9 ("multi-distro") support, Cloud in a Box for Kubernetes or OpenStack Ironic only, Ceph Rook (Technical Preview)

### Software licences and licence conflicts

- this comes from SIG Std/Cert, but could be relevant to others as well
- what licences do we use for our code (AGPLv3 and Apache 2?) and docs (CC-BY[-SA]), and how can we make sure there are no conflicts with the libraries that we use?
- Automation possible via [Dependency Track](https://dependencytrack.org)
    - Will be worked on as part of SBOM work to systematically avoid conflicts
- [SCS License considerations](https://docs.scs.community/community/license-considerations)
- [List of our repo licenses](https://input.scs.community/bKv0NIG0QymKEOas5AQibg#)
    - to be completed and checked for conflicts
