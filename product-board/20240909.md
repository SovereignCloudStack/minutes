### R8 planning

- Work with community on plans
  - High level goals always make sense
  - Reflect reduced scope with funded work
- Assume R8 in March 2025 ...
- Topics for R8: Brainstroming
  - Federation
    - Will be a big topic also in vPTG
    - Some of this will be R9, R10 topics
  - SCS compliance test automation
    - To Do: Create better (and more visible) documentation and then find out what is missing
      - More visible documentation!
      - Blog article!
    - @mbuechse has more plans
    - Professional design for the label
    - Old table: <https://docs.scs.community/standards/certification/overview>
    - Table of new compliance monitor: <https://compliance.sovereignit.cloud/page/table>, should look better
    - Scripts docs reachable via <https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0004-v1-achieving-certification> (click on `SCS compliance test suite` and see SCS compliance commands)
      - Consider to make SCS compliance commands more visible in the main docs page
  - SCS standards
    - IaaS v5, KaaS v1
  - Turnkey, turnkey, turnkey

### Continuing turnkey solution work

- Central list of all repositories, documentation, artifacts
- Integration of pieces with each other
- Artifacts are immutable (hashes)
- Build SBOMs
  - Central CI (zuul)
  - Central Registry (harbor)
- Automation to pull a defined set of artifacts together
  - Fixed set
  - Vuln scanning, SBOMs
- Continuous updates happen, minor updates (semver) are tested, SBOMs created, ...
  - Automation
