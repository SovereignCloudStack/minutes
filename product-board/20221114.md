## Agenda

### Keycloak quo vadis?
* https://github.com/osism/release/pull/621
    - keycloak integrated into OSISM in order to make federation possible (also in context of Gaia-X)
    - was meant to be a temporary solution ... OSISM not skilled to maintain keycloak
    - who maintains it? tender lot 8 winner?
    - how to deploy it?
    - what is the place for the IAM service / IAM broker in our architecture?
* Do we need a generic mechanism to add containers to the OSISM deployment?
    - plugin mechanism for playbooks and containers?
    	* exists - requires custom ansible playbooks currently and then deploying additional containers into docker/docker-compose
    - Future roadmap from OSISM: Provide a k8s cluster in the management plane, so operator can automate the deployment of extra services (e.g. for Ops tooling or for IAM)
    	* using minikube / k3s / ... for the OSISM management cluster (~3 hosts)
    	* even an external k8s cluster could be used
    - Create a Hackathon project for this (@berendt):
