* Input needed (highlights, ...)
### CSP input for [CPU vuln Blog](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/pull/722)?
* Push it out now, could follow up with CSP perspective
### Velocity in regards to decision making / standards
* too slow, don't manage to come to final conclusions
* decision taking - need active participation and empowerment to take decision in the meeting (see also <https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/daci>)
* offline RfC proces: Happening via PRs already, reminders via chat/email may help
