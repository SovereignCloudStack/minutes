## Agenda
### Decision about "heat" as supported service
Contra:
- This means that we'd need to not introduce the new role standard (or fix heat to support it)

Pro:
- Some CSPs offer it and don't want to break it, so we'd need to go through a deprecation cycle ...

| CSP      | heat |
| ----     | ---- |
| PCO      | yes  |
| wave     | yes  |
| artcodix | yes  |
| aov      | ?    |
| regio    | no   |
| PoC WGCloud | no   |
| PoC KDO     | ?    |
| SysEleven   | yes  |
| scaleUp     | ?    |

- Customers tend to prefer terraform over heat
- Autoscaling feature in heat may be a USP
    - Does it really work? Is autoscaling really used? Is heat used at all?
        - @neuroserve may know more (@frosty-geek to ask)
    - Monasca, Mistral may be alternatives to implement autoscaling
- Used for demos (@PS)
    - Could likely be deprecated if it becomes too hard to keep working and supported
- Upstream low activity (maintenance only)
- Issue likely addressed in 2024.2 (to be validated by @gtema)


### Potential R7 highlights (2024-09-04)
* One product
    * Rollout SCS ClusterStack Mgmt Cluster (Kamaji?)
* Finalize KaaS SCS-compatible standards scope v1
    * Complete test coverage
    * And gain adopters
        * PSKE can (almost) do it
            * Except for patch levels within a week
            * HostID tags not yet there upstream
        * who else -> AI @garloff/@mbuechse
* Finalize KaaS v1 -> v2 migration
* VMware -> SCS migration
    * VM HA?
    * Infra HA?
    * Migration Guide
* Keycloak as 1st class member
    * production grade helm deployment (clustered, hardened, observability, standardized, ...)
    * realm templating
    * ID federation - ExternalIdM -> KC)
      (keystone 2 keycloak is incomplete, target R8 aka 2024.2=Dalmatian for completion)
* Central-API & GUI?
* Sec Pipeline & SBOMs
* Layer3 Underlay/SDN and EVPN / Networking scalability?
    * TechPreview? Production? Reviews still open ...
* ceph-rook?
* Status page
* ARM support
    * mandatory: compute nodes
    * controllers, storage nodes, ... can come in a later step

### R7 release plan announcements
* TODO: @garloff to do blog post
    * 2024-07-10 RC1(!)
        * Feature freeze (with selected exceptions)
        * Collect in PO group

### GPU flavor @ PS
* `SCS-16V-64-256s_GNl-18176` may not be the preferred name by PS
    * Should be `SCS-16V-64-256s_Gnl-142` for a L40

### S3 a mandatory feature of SCS?
* Yes
* A Standard is still missing that says this explicitly
* Does this require a second ceph
    * Normally enough to have separate pools inside one ceph
        * Static allocation?
        * Can be done dynamically (but making pools smaller is not so easy)
        * Possible in OSISM (but not done by default)
* [PS](https://docs.plusserver.com/en/compute/pluscloudopen/introduction/resources/storage/#object-storage): 20k files 20GB limitation of built-in [PCO radosgw](https://docs.plusserver.com/en/compute/pluscloudopen/reference/object-storage/), [separate product](https://docs.plusserver.com/en/storage-backup/s3-storage/) available
* Wave: RadosGW serving objetcs from multiple cephs from all AZs
