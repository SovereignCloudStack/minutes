## Agenda

### Ceph Pacific vs. Quincy

- https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/525
    - Regio.cloud updating this week, @nerdicbynature watching
    - shifted by ~1wk, but with full alignment
    - PS will do maintenance around it as well (kernel upgrades etc.)

### Decision process for Standard flavors and naming scheme
- Two proposals exist:
    - [SCS-0100-v3](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0100-v3-flavor-naming.md)
    - [PS proposal](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/files/11404393/SCS.flavor-naming_PSwatchmen.pdf)
        - Wants "Generation" in name
        - Complex flavors will never match between providers
- We may not find agreement (beyond that we should improve discoverability independent of naming and also work towards IaC tools not being as name dependent any more).
    - Even the intermediate mitigation to improve compat is not universally agreed: Flavor aliases in OpenStack or abstraction in relevant IaC tools?
- Decision taking: Voting?
    - One wo:man one vote?
        - NO
    - 50% reprentatives from providers, 50% from users?
        - => We will do this, @garloff to write proposal
            - Identify representative users (short of a user forum)
- Really need to conclude this!
- Alternative: OSBA project team decides?

### GXFS knowledge
#### Background
- GXFS (new: Eclipse XFSC) is our sister project (the two early BMWK-funded projects to support Gaia-X)
- syself has created and managed SCS k8s clusters on PlusServer IaaS (paid for by eco from BMWK funds) and provided k8s support and a lot of integration tooling (including database ...)
    - PaaS services from syself: DB, secret manager, app observability/monitoring, ...
    - Create helm charts for all these
- Hard to set up -- typically done with syself support on SCS IaaS ...
    - Microservices not yet playing well with each other ...
- GXFS considered a "standard Gaia-X building block" by many (e.g. Cosmic-X), more prominent than SCS
    - Mostly limited to the ...-X bubble currently
- How useful is it really? Building block to set up trustable data federations? Research? Judgement?
- GXFS lacks a managed GXFS offering (no operator).
    - Operations as an afterthought ...
    - Requirements not well documented
- Goverance of software transitioning to Eclipse ...
    - CI processes broken at this point (since Jun 1), as integr envs have been shut down
#### Ideas
- Re-use syself integration tooling / services? E.g. DBaaS?
- Build an integrated "SCS+GXFS" implementation?
- Suggest to SCS operators to offer managed GXFS?
    - Plus with SCS IaaS and PSKE/Gardener k8s?
- Broaden GXFS setup skills?
    - [EUproGigant](https://euprogigant.com/en/project/euprogigant-and-gaia-x/): A1 / exoscale (Antoine) - lacks a capi provider
