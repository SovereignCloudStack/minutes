## Agenda

### Personas
* https://input.osb-alliance.de/p/2022-scs-personas
    - Next step: Move to Docs in git
    - Is a living document
    - Key roles (such as e.g. "SCS Operator") should be stable -> dictionary ("Glossary")

### Standards:
* SCS-0001: Stabilization
* PR#150 (SCS-0110): Merging as draft
* Version numbers: Need minor versions in doc?
* Image metadata effectiveness (depending on image-manager)
* Standards will become more and more important!
    - secunet/secustack
    - StackIT
    - ...
  as alternative SCS-compliant implementations
    - Motivate to collaborate in SCS community
    - Start writing more standards (focus: Container layer! @garloff)
    - Start pushing certification program / ecosystem (@alexander-diab)

=> Create blog post (-> @garloff. @alexander-diab)

### Requirements forwarding
* Container -> IaaS:
    - Always encrypt ceph (SED or CPU) https://input.osb-alliance.de/p/2022-scs-team-container
     https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/214
    - Standard Storage survives loss of single storage node / storage medium without intervention
    - flavor-manager development (wanted b/f stabilizing SSD flavors SCS-0110)
    - Purge disks https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/369
* Protocol: Open issues and assign IaaS labels and talk here?
    - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/46

### Review request forwarding
* How to get reviews for openstack-health-monitor ... ?
    - Used versions (@pco, @wave) ahead of main, will have trouble to converge all branches if this continues too far
      => Only ask one or two reviewers

### Doc - Architecture diagram generation
* Current arch is a hard-to-edit eps/pdf
* yaml description or UML-2 would be nice (C4 model)
    - Creating a nice-looking graphics/visualization will continue to be manual work
    - get inspiration from OpenStack / Gaia-X SDs
    - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/gx-self-description-generator
* @maxwolfs to look into this

### Finalize Product Board format

**Required participants**
* @garloff
* @berendt
* @itrich
* @wolfs
* @fkr
* @frosty-geek
* all further SCS POs forthcoming
