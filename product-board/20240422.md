## Agenda

### OpenStack Services Supported by SCS IaaS Reference Implementation (@fkr)

- Alignment for Discussion on wednesday
- https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/528
- https://input.scs.community/list-of-required-recommended-and-optional-openstack-projects#
- Goal is to finalize this by Wed
    - Upstream unsupported projects can not go on the list without fixing upstream
    - Our community can contribute and find others to contribute if we need things from the unsupported list

### Day-2 Operations IaaS Reference Implementation / LCM (@fkr / @scoopex)

- Regular maintenance tasks, LCM
- Improve tooling
- Documentation

*Standard Operations / Open Operations*
- Need input from our CSP partners -- culture of collaboration
    - SCS project role is to facilitate this not to be the main input for this
- There are some pieces, but not enough (e.g. https://github.com/pluscloudopen/osism-opstools)
- Free internal docs and tools

*How to get more input*
- Talk to CSPs (all layers)
    - Do we need C-level buy-in?
        - We *should* have this already
    - We need to get traction at the DevOps teams from our CSPs
    - The "Operator RoundTable"
        - Collect feedback on what formats work for them
    - Continuous contribution needed (code, docs, issues)
        - Technical collaboration
    - Motivation:
        - Visibility? Bountys? ...

- Collecting best practices, guides, ...

- Locations: Operations guides, Blog, Open Operations meetups, ...

- OSISM repositories / places:
  - https://github.com/osism/osism.github.io/tree/main/docs/guides/operations-guide
  - https://github.com/osism/kolla-operations
  - tool repositories like https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager

- Examples: gx-scs challenges ahead of R6 (octavia, storage)
    - Public RCA wanted (dashboards, logs, analysis, improvements, ...)
        - Also preliminary information while the analysis is still ongoing
    - Place: Blog articles (could add a section dedicated for Day 2)

### Day 2 operations for large scale environments
- Large scale operations
    - Need to identify specific issues
        - E.G. Restart times for containers (https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/973) and OSDs
    - Can only be done in close collaboration with CSPs that face these challenges
        - Invitation from PS is highly welcome
        - TBD: Open issues to request improvements
- PS tooling that automates some things
    - Should be shared
    - Should be considered for upstreaming into OSISM / kolla / OpenStack
    - To Do:
        - Record issues as they arise and try to report them
        - Do a post mortem after crunch time and go through the issues to clean them up and get things reported and improved upstream
