## Agenda

### Upstream Items not finished in the course of funding (@fkr, @bitkeks)

- How to handle these?
    - Wait for upstream activity, if nothing can be done from our side
    - Drop the issue if there's no requirement forseeable from upstream community
    - Original assignees can take the issue with them into their own companies, but no guarantees for SCS
    - If it's an urgent issue for SCS and the assignees are available for some time (until end of year for example), we can prioritize pushing for upstream activity
    - The pursuing SCS community organization (what will become of the SCS community) can pick up the issue -> needs governance and planning
- Which items are these - do we have a list / idea?
    - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/21
    - VP04 upstream related to kolla-ansible
    - VP06c
        - [host ID](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/issues/2579)
        - [Server Groups](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-openstack/pull/1912)
