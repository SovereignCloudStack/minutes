## Agenda

### Adjusted development flow / meeting structure IaaS (@fkr)
* Team IaaS meetings does not work as well as it should, despite various attempts to tweak it
    * Key stakeholders missing
        * Only a small core core of people reliably (and actively) participating
    * Not enough interaction
        * PO should not have to use his whip all the time
* Every 2 weeks: Sprint review and planning
    * Prepared separately by development partner (tender pkg winners)
    * Most relevant topics from per pkg discussions will be added to the IaaS team meet
    * Community call reporters will be chosen round-robin by @fkr
    * Same for minutes-taking
    * Also handle agenda preparation by delegating to tender pkg winners (also add estimated time)
    * Keep Team IaaS meeting to coordinate across tender pkgs and allow others to chime in
        * Operators
        * Community outside of tender pkg winners
* Matrix or mailing list?
    * use both (overcommunication is better than missing communication)
*  Decision taking
    *  Continues to happen in team IaaS
    *  Special meets with open invites
*  CSP feedback
    *  Continue trying to get more

### Setting goals / wanted outcomes for R6
* IaaS: SCS lab is now ready
    * This enables SONIC, ARM, ...
    * SCS is multi-plattform
* KaaS: Cluster Stacks, Cluster Stack Operator, and migration KaaS v1 (k8s-cluster-api-operator) -> v2 (cluster stacks)
    * intermediate step using cluster classes in v1
    * see also blog post
* Big vision: Full Stack Reference Implementation
* Monitoring/Observability (all layers)
* Large scale, highly reliable operations
* AI @fkr, @garloff, ... to write this down as outcomes

### IaaS standards v1 have expired 2023-10-31
* v2 should expire 2023-11-30, though v3 needs stabilization still
* Extend a few weeks?
* Challenges for PS: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/379
    - R5 in prod3 does fulfill v2
    - v3 requires local SSDs
    - Ralf is out of office
* Decision: Give them a few more weeks to recover (and to do some more finetuning on v3)
    - Escalation to PS
        - Ralf (@fkr and @garloff)
        - and Christian Schmitz (@garloff)
    - But we can't wait forever without losing credibility
    - PS: Hyperconverged setup can do this, would also help with key-value performance challenges

### SCS labs
* Good progress: Finalizing cabling currently
