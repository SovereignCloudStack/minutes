## Agenda

### New team meeting schedule
- Conflict @ Gonicus:
    - Thu 1hr earlier: Yes
- Conflict @ C&H:
    - No solution yet

### Improve Product Board
- Cleaned up participants
- Scope is medium term (4 -- 16 wk) cross - team / cross - SIG topics
- Long-term strategic view is outside of PB, to be defined
    - "Steering committee" / Board of advisors
    - Reviews with partners / customers ...

### (fkr) SIG Release
- Release in ~7.5 weeks
- How can include more community contributions to release engineering and coordination?
    - Ask for participation in community meeting
    - Input for digest input 'till Thu: Define date!

### (fkr) Kubernetes on control plane / OSISM
- Create mechanism for management plane extensibility: k8s
- Technically available since May (playbooks, roles, ...), not yet visible / switched on
- k3s cluster w/ kube-VIP and metal-LB
    - move cluster from management nodes to control plane nodes after bootstrapping (avoid single managment host SPOF)
    - no storage (yet)
- Next steps
    - Enable in testbed (with 3 parameters)
    - Test porting keycloak to it
    - Enable cluster-API mgmt plane
    - Enable usage of clusters via magnum (upstream work from vexxhost & StackHPC)
    - Technical preview in 5.3.0, could be stabilized for 6.0.0
    - Discussion: bootstrap issue: magnum needs keystone needs IdP needs k8s
    - yaook-core for management plane k8s possibly later (not yet as mature as k3s)
    - Storage (better than hostPath)
    - Integration of Central-API-Service idea (Cluster-Management)
    - Blog Post

### (fkr) How to proceed with Skyline
- Nice extensible design
- Is deployed already, but not yet used by default
- Not yet very mature, getting there quickly (99cloud investing heavily)
- Makes most sense if we want to have a SCS dashboard (web-UI) beyond just OpenStack
    - Extending Horizon does not make sense
- AI @garloff: Ask @flyersa (Enrico) for a demo (Lightning talk or so)
- Testing:
    - `osism apply skyline`
    - [in DevStack](https://opendev.org/openstack/skyline-apiserver/src/branch/master/devstack)
