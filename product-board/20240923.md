- Real deployments:
  - Regio.Cloud not yet upgraded (due to vacation)
  - PS in progress
    - Dev done
    - SCS1 (gx-scs) has the last RC
    - SCS2 will be done soon
    - Prod: planned in October (Prod Oct 19)
    - See <https://status.plusserver.com>
  - Wavecon
    - No dates yet
- Minor release OSISM v8.0.1 planned for tomorrow EOB
  - netbox issue (only new manager image)
  - k3s node labeling
- Further idea: VM based testing (one health-mon iteration?)

### Schedule for SCS-compatible IaaS v5 and KaaS v1

#### Progress

- Docs are being updates based on feedback from last PB
- Compliance monitor (fed by zuul)
- Testing clouds without public access

#### November timeline for both IaaS-v5 and KaaS-v1

### SBOM creation

- <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/pull/28>
- yaml file with all artifacts, used by tool to analyze them (in DependencyTrack)
- More review welcome
  - Completeness?
- How to deal with found vulnerabilities (alerting)
  - Please contact @gtema for (read-only) access to DependencyTrack
  - SBOMs can be downloaded
- Quite some critical vulns in [DependencyTrack](https://dependencytrack.infra.sovereignit.cloud)
  - Back to green: Requires to audit issues and address them (or filter them out)
  - Development process should use Security Tab in github
  - Conclusions taken there could be copied to DependencyTrack (manually)
    - ideas on automation based on e.g. CVE numbers to transfer information from github -> DependencyTrack
- Lots of external components will always result in a lot of vulnerability input
  - Need to become efficient in auditing it
  - Typical response is by just updating the dependency on critical vulns (rather than analyzing whether it does really affect you)
    - results in a lot of churn (with minor changes)
    - also requires upstream projects to be careful in not breaking things

### Product Board -> Project Board

- Started archiving old repos ...
