## Agenda

### Document PB scope & particpation (@garloff)
- Finetuned description, mentioned high-level quarterly product review
- Participant list should be relatively constant (-> AI @garloff mail)
- Will add to https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/pull/454
- Sync content with Docs/Contributor-Docs/ ?
  -> please take to SIG Community

### Testing & CI framework
- zuul focus after R2 ... are we ready to roll this out more broadly
- need to onboard SCS community (knowledge transfer)
  -> still waiting for SCS -Zuul Infra

### IaaS Networking
- IPv6: Progress? (https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/166)
    * Need AS for testing / development
- IPv4: Write ADR on model (private networks, router, SNAT, FIPs from ExtNet, ...) (https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/167)
    * Need some research to understand how it's done on real-world clouds
    * Artem might have insight (from SDK dev perspective)
    * Standard-relevant are the user-visible pieces
- ADR on Default DNS, NTP? -> IaaS team meet
    * Write proposal -> Issue for IaaS team (TODO: @garloff)
    * Should have transparency what external DNS is used
    * NTP makes sense as well (fallback kvm-clock from host which then must be NTP'ed ???) => second proposal
    * RNG virtio-rng from host required => third ADR

### Rolling out semi-public Monitoring for OpenOps partners
- OS-HM
    * gx-scs, pco, wavestack semi-public
    * stackit (non-public)
    * betacloud? => January
    * cleura? => Yes - use to push stackit, TSI (but possibly directly use cloudmon)
    * OTC?
    * ... ?
- OS-HM would need to be completely rewritten (in python) if it should have a future
    * Deprecate as soon as cloudmon is a few steps further
- cloudmon/apimon?
    * rollout somewhat complex, too OTC specific, needs simplification
* => SIG Monitoring participation wanted
