## Agenda

### Docs Strategy
* @frostygeek wonders whether a decentral system with many links would not be better than a central docs.scs.community (which "duplicates" the information)
* As long as we don't duplicate the source of information, we won't disallow local publications
* Make source of information visible (link github sources?)

### Preparing R4
* Release goals?
  - See https://scs.community/tech/2022/11/04/outcomes-for-r4/
  - SCS is standardized
    * ADRs, Standards, Tests, Alasca TechTalk
  - SCS is federated
    * Keystone patch, on its way upstream, Blog article
  - SCS is continuously built and tested
    * testbed tests stable state, main, previoustable, upgrade previousstable->stable
    * see "list of OSISM testbed CI jobs" (below)
      - collaborative effort, sponsored resources from SCS open operations provider community
    * TODO (maybe past R4?): Create stable environments for more jobs, wait for community hardware (->Backlog for R5)
  - SCS is understandable
    * docs.scs.community, yeah!
    * Cloud-in-a-Box as possible entry point
  - SCS enables Operators with an excellent toolbox
    * image-manager, flavor-manager
    * validate commands, logs retrieval, ... (-> OSISM release notes, TODO: extract highlights and reference)
    * WIP: monitoring (-> R5)
      - elasticsearch replaced by opensearch (https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/318)
  - SCS helps to jump start the Open Operations movement
    * Lean Operator coffee
    * Further partners collaborating in operational topics, Alasca+SCS
  - Upstream highlights:
    * Ubuntu 22.04
    * Skyline dashboard (optional, backported as Tech Preview)
    * magnum - cluster-api integration (Vexxhost, StackHPC, ...) (https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/436)
    * More big things from OpenStack, Kubernetes, ... (TODO: Collect)
* Finalizing feature work
  - What is in, what is TechPreview, what is out?
  - Where are we with Doc and Testing?
* Communication / Press
  - Highlights from technology / release notes R4
  - Community progress (Hackathon, Summit)
  - Feature cloud providers, ecosystem partners??? -> potentially split out
  - Feature new community contributors (companies)? -> potentially split out
  - Rolling upgrades (since 1.5yrs without stopping customer workloads), reproducable state -> separate PR?
* Release SIG?
  - @berendt, @fkr, @jschoone, @garloff, @itrich
* Release date?
  - R4: 2023-03-22 (EOL R3: 2023-04-30, as planned)
  - Open question: Underlaying OS upgrade from Ubuntu 20.04 -> 22.04 required?
    * Now or later ... no pressure (~1/2 year time 2023-10-30)

* Release notes for OSISM: https://release.osism.tech/notes/5.0.0.html
* list of OSISM testbed CI jobs (daily)
