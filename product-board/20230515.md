## Agenda
### Welcome Sven

### Local root exploit (LPE) Linux kernel CVE-2023-32233
* netfilter anonymous sets use-after-free
* allows overwriting kernel memory -> root, container escape
* virtualization isolation (hypervisor) intact
* bad for workloads that depend on isolation within a VM
    * users should upgrade their VMs (as soon as kernel updates are available)
    * new public images, new capi node images for k8s-capi to support users
* no cross-user or user-operator isolation breach in SCS scenarios found yet
    * IaaS: no unprivileged access to hosts possible
    * KaaS: VMs belong to the customer anyway
    * Are there really none?
* TODO:
    * New public images (after upstream kernel updates)
    * New capi node images (dito)
    * Blog post? / Advisory? ("Why local root is not as bad as it used to be?") => NO
        * Should document when and when not we do advisories / blog articles, start with HedgeDoc: https://input.scs.community/KuMlk7YUSNKvLjmWHTvjqg#Advisories-in-our-blog (@FriederikeZelke)
    * Next minor release with updated kernels => No kernels in OSISM container(!) images
        * amphorae may need rebuilding

### Ceph Quincy update?
* Meeting Tue May 16, 16:05 CEST

### Flavor naming discussion
* Thanks for participation
* Followup:
    * Moving some currently mandatory flavors to recommended (AI: suggestion from @frosty-geek)
        * @garloff to write down Ralf's proposal: All 13 flavors with disks become "recommended", the 13 without remain "mandatory", the two new ones with SSDs remain mandatory
            * It would be nice to have flavors with local disks but variable size
    * Investigation flavor aliases, API gateway, tool support to make names less relevant
    * Voting on PS proposal vs SCS-v2 (AI @garloff)

### SCS Cluster Stacks
* will be the new reference implementation for Kubernetes
* based on capi cluster classes
* epics work in progress
* can be done different IaaS implementations (providers)
* we implement the OpenStack (SCS-IaaS) one
* visual representation highly desirable (@jschoone, @batistein)
* solution will be split over several github repositories
    * operator approach (superceding the current scripts on the management node)
    * provider-specific directories
    * avoiding unneeded dependencies
* seed/bootstrap cluster no longer needed after bootstrap (`clusterctl move`) - bootstrap can be any k8s cluster, if nothing pre-exists, we create a kind cluster

### Public health dashboards
* Broad support (need to double check with wavecon)
* Listing URLs no problem for PS, full access via github SCS org membership, not full public access yet (pending PS Marketing alignment), move prod1, prod2, gx-scs into one grafana instance
* Move URL towards pages that document cloud access
* Medium-term: Fully public (once grafana has the feature, public SCS certifications, ...)
* @maxwolfs to find best place (docs pages for now)
