## Agenda

### Outcomes for R4
* Input: https://scs.sovereignit.de/nextcloud/apps/files/?dir=/Sovereign%20Cloud%20Stack/Technology/ProductBoard&openfile=122756
* Large Topics, larger than single epics
* Outcomes => SCS labels (gh/SCS/issues repo)
* Hierarchy of Goals: Product Vision -> Outcomes -> Epics -> UserStories
* Process: Felix+Kurt to formulate this in a draft blog post (this week)
  -> Review/Input/Contribution/Rewrite by Product Board & broader SCS community wanted
  -> Goal is to publish next week, if we need more discussions the week after next

### Base permission in SCS GitHub org
* Changed rights to write permissions for all members of SCS github org for all repos
  - Allows merging by everyone (after review by another person)
  - We have mostly documentation, process descriptions, compliance checks, ... which are not security critical
  - Helps with avoiding delays with maintainers bottlenecking
  - We can always revert this (when the community grows much larger) and create core maintainer teams if we find out challenges
  - Extra visibility for great contributors/reviewers/testers/janitors will be provided independently of "core maintainer status", e.g. list of contributors, invitations to summits, stickers, blogs, ...

=> Decision: Allow this for now - No need to broadly announce this ... now
