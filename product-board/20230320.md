## Agenda

### ceph Pacific is default in R4, but goes out of upstream maint in June
* How to deal with it
    * Past R4 (but pre-R5) upgrade to Quincy?
        * Upgrade in May/June (R4.x) not a problem for PS
        * Quincy not stable enough?
            * TODO: Watch this closely, try to reassess and influence/contribute to upstream
            * Reassessment should have well-documented approach: How do we measure "not stable enough"
            * Upgrade process is already implemented, testing can start anytime (e.g. on gx-scs)
    * Maintenance promise past June by own backports/sec fixes?
    * No maintenance for ceph past June?
* How to communicate internally
* How to communicate this to the Operators/Public
* Expectation setting towards maintenance of SCS ref.impl. durig the 7.5 months lifetime
    * What do we want to deliver for free as community?
        * Who does what?
    * Where do we want commercial offers from partners?

### OVS / OVN version
* Newer version of OVN wanted
    * Currently R4 on 3.0.1 and 22.09.0 (which addresses many issues already)
        * -> 5.0.0b build
    * More existing issues are addressed in 3.1/23.03
    * 3.1/23.x requires building from source
        * Not in R4 (R4.0/v5.0.0)
    * Target R4.1/v5.1.0 for 3.1/23.x
        * PS supports this

### Handling version update planning
* Past strategy: Use well matured versions (OpenStack Zed just before Antelope gets released), not necessarily "latest stable"
    * Keeping old versions; upgrade only if the components are in danger of running out of maintenance or are no longer supported by other components
* 6 month release cycle does sometimes not match well
    * Smaller steps are desirable
    * More rolling release
* Document our approach
    * Need to have test, monitoring, benchmark data
    * Should also undergo an open discussion
    * Try to collect experience with versions -> upstream? -> SCS community?

### v2 flavor naming
* How to proceed and conclude?
    * Separate discussion slot needs to be planned (@fkr)
