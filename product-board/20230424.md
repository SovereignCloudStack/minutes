  Context: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/pull/407#discussion_r1170919136

### CI and zuul progress
* Plan for broader usage and knowledge transfer
* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/243#issuecomment-1519508007
* OSISM willing and ready to support @master-caster as desired

### Hardware procurement
* Need to avoid losing more time to avoid breaking zuul/CI plans

### Audit logging breakout
* Currently no support/demand from CSPs
* Stop activities for now ("on hold")

### STF - SCS connection
* Check if we use or want to use any of the projects supported by STF

### IaaS focus too strong in Product Board
* Larger providers using SCS-IaaS (OSISM) are not using our capi/capo
* Smaller ones do (AOV, sXperts customers, ...)
* Overall capi space is large, including even large-scale deployment
* Need more focus also in management team
* Prepare strategy discussion for next PB meetings
