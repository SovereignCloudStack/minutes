## Agenda

### Release Date of Release 7

- R7 is planned for release on Wednesday, Sept 4 2024
    - Sponsored project time ends on 30th of september (so we have a time reserve)
    - the first rc will be created on 10.7.2024
    - testing of the upcoming release as soon as possible in the VP18 hardware landscape
- This was done to have buffer time in relation to Sept 30
- RC1 10.7., RC2 24.7., RC3 7.8., RC4 21.8.
    - Do we need RCs if testing is foreseeably thin?
    - Testing capacity limited in vacation time (July and August)
    - plusserver people are ready 24/7
    - "Rolling release"? -- Create testing roadmap with devs + CSPs capacities
- OSISM not dependant on release, Caracal can be tested as soon as wanted
    - OSISM images are available
    - OpenStack Caracal release is planned for April, which will be a good base for SCS testing
