## Agenda

### SCS R7 rollout

- PS Prod4 is SCS-compliant IaaS-v4
- Any other observations?
  - No major issue
- More regions @PS will follow

### Designate issue @artcodix

- Designate issues @ Artcodix/CNDS (not sure if related to the Designate upgrade itself (<https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/1157>))
  - Caused by stuck messages in rabbitmq queue between designate-api and designate-central
  - Suspicion that it's related to a different backend (pdns) was wrong

### OSISM v8.0.2

### Cluster Stack blueprint with Kamaji, DEX,

### Standards scopes SCS-compatible IaaS-v5 and KaaS-v1 in November

- KaaS standards vs Gardener
  - Should be possible
  - Needs checking
- KaaS: Lacks tests
  - WIP (C&H, VP10)
- KaaS version policy not realistic from PS perspective
  - Needs follow up discussions (Johann Knauke @ PS w/ SCS team/SIG Std+Cert) -- AI @garloff
