## Agenda

### @garloff to check currency of product-board mailing list
_Hint: Managed by UCS group product-board_

### How to move forward with OpenStack Health Monitor

* VP12 needs to be filled with some details on where the future will take us
* While we concluded in the past that something like CloudMon is the way to go, OpenStack Health Monitor is the project that still receives much more work and focus.
* Discussion resulted in a decision to continue with a cloud-mon-like reimplementation (this is what VP12 is all about)
  and EOL openstack-health-monitor soon, stop adding features, shut down in next months, full focus on VP12
* Kurt to take over the cloud health monitoring topic
* Knowledge transfer (@fkr -> @garloff) needed

### Standardization

* We risk to move backwards if we give up on the existing systematic flavor naming and list of mandatory flavors and start reopening discussions and questioning the [strategy](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Drafts/flavor-naming-strategy.md) that we had more than a year ago. Downgrading to recommendation would also be a step back, as selecting flavors by properties [is hard](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/287).
* Moving forward: [v1 Standard](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Drafts/flavor-naming.md) is out there, [v2](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0100-v2-flavor-naming.md) is in Draft. Stabilize? Create [transition plan](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/228)? Wait for v3?
* Need to agree on this following the usual procedure described in [scs-0001](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0001-v1-sovereign-cloud-standards.md); using the mailing list and team meets to ensure we have an open and transparent process where everyone can participate.
    * Do we have a problem with participation in the IaaS team? Noone with customers? 
        * Need to motivate more Operators to participate in IaaS team!
            * @garloff to send yet another invite
        * The customers (DevOps teams) are the real stakeholders here
            * Ideal would be to have users just express the wanted specs
            * Need to invest into documenting (and enhancing?) upstream IaC tooling if we don't want to standardize names
            * Would still need standardized flavors (by properties, not names)
            * Focus on `extra_specs` standardization, sync with upstream effort: https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/publiccloud-sig-specs
            * More contact to customers via sxperts, syself, gxfs, adesso, ...
