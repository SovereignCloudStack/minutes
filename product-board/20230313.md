## Agenda

### Use [Archive](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/tracking-work-with-project-boards/archiving-cards-on-a-project-board) on GitHub board
* For tasks for which there is no longer a need to talk, like `Done`, `Abandoned`, `Won't fix`, ...
* Do we have a feature where we could have `Done R3`, `Done R4` categories that could be hidden?
* `Done` should be reviewed in team once and can then go to `Archived`
* Overcrowded `Blocked` or `Abandonded` can also be cleaned up after team review by archiving. (Do this at least after each Release.)

### Release Notes
* Goal is to have >90% 'till Wed
    * Container will get done by then
        * Todo: Merge highlights into main release notes
    * OSISM notes have been kept up2date
        * Idea: Change to reno for better structuring release notes past R4 (-> retro)
        * Manual curation has value, though
* Input https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/pull/5

### Syncing sprint starts to even weeks
* IAM, IaaS, Ops teams will start a new sprint in the release week (cwk 12)
* Adjust container meeting to make sure what happens in which week

### Standards finalization b/f R4?
* See <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Tests/scs-compatible.yaml>
* Image metadata standard needs transfer into new format
* Add Test for KaaS standard storage standard
* Communication separate from R4, in preparation for SCS Summit
    * April 2023 => The month for SCS standards!
        * and automatic compliance tests!

### SCS R4 and Ubuntu 22.04?
* 22.04 default for new deployments
* CI still on 20.04, will migrate after R4
* 22.04 not yet required for R4, both still allowed
    * Will change for R5

* OSISM in plan
* AOV (AI @garloff)
