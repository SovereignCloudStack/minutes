## Agenda
### R5 schedule
* OSISM 5.3.0: 2023-09-03 --> https://release.osism.tech/notes/5.3.0.html
    * Some fallout was resolved from moving from github actions to zuul
* OSISM 6.0.0a (RC): 2023-09-07 (EOB) --> https://github.com/osism/release/tree/main/6.0.0a

### Vault in osism (fkr)
* hashicorp's BSL license change affects vault
* vault used in TSI (== T-Systems International GmbH) PoC (provided by TSI as a Service)
    * The one place to store secrets
* Not a blocker for TSI
    * Stay on MPL licensed version there for now
    * TSI may just license the BSL version from hashicorp
* OSISM has ansible-vault for other setups
    * Not using hashicorp vault
* OSISM had prepared to consume hashicorp vault, not yet integrated, not required
    * Integration will remain a separate optional component

### Technical Preview Metering in R5? (fkr)
* Integration into testbed currently happening
* Ship as TechPreview for R5 would help getting exposure to make it production quality for R6

### Personas in SCS
* See [Glossary](https://docs.scs.community/docs/glossary#personas)
* Role for Service Operators / K8s Operators (which may not be the IaaS Operator nor the User) lacking

### Private issues in SCS
* All 86 members of SCS org have write+triage+read rights on all SCS repos ("base permission")
* Private issues needed for a few cases -- e.g. sensitive potential security issues (responsible disclosure)
* Will probably need 2ndary org in github "SCS-private" ... investigate
