## Agenda
### List of supported OpenStack services
* Standardization view talks about APIs of services that need to be provided ("mandatory") and the one that will be taken into consideration when defining standards ("supported" thus has a specific meaning here)
* Dealt with in IaaS team

### Status VMware -> SCS migration
* Do we have comparisons ... ?
    * Ask stackXperts, B1 Systems, ... (AI @garloff)
    * Could be a topic for OpenOperations (getting real life experience)
* v2v Tooling
    * Hystax (Commercial, works well for large no of Win VMs)
    * Coriolis (Not fully OSS?)
    * UhuruTec (FOSS, see [Docs](https://osism.tech/docs/guides/user-guide/migration-vmware-esix))
        * Works well for simple scenarios (Linux VMs)
    * ?
* VM HA feature
    * VM behavior in case of host actions:
      What is current OpenStack default behavior?
      What is wanted default? What controls?
        * a1) Planned maintenance w/ live-migratable VMs
            *Operator decides; most do always do LM*
        * a2) Planned maintenance w/ non-live-migratable VMs, no standardized control
            *OpenStack: VMs are restarted when host restarts, no standardized control (PS has introduced one, see below)*
        * b1) Unexpected host outage w/ short-term host recovery
            *OpenStack: VMs are restarted when host restarts, no control*
        * b2) Unexpected host outage w/o short-term recovery
            *dito (so VMs might come up again after a long time ...)*
    * PS-specific a2 setting: `ps_restart_after_maint=true`
        * https://github.com/plusserver/docs/commit/4113402ed6824ba22c33f77b53801ce0560c2052
    * Should SCS standardize this? ([Standards #580](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/580))
        * Yes

### Cluster Stacks on other (non-SCS-IaaS-Reference-Implementation) environments
* Our own SCS Cluster Stack dev focus is on SCS-compliant IaaS
    * Allowing for variations (yawoll) *if it can be done without introducing signifcant work/complexity*
* Plus enabling developers (-> docker)
* Open to others to contribute integrations into their own stacks
    * We strongly prefer openly developed open source ( 4xopen) stacks
    * Conditions for them to live on github/SCS/?
* Current project (dNation)
    * Using Hetzer Bare Metal (not Hetznercloud) and put k8s-OpenStack-k8s Sandwich on top
        * using Cluster Stacks w/ Cluster-API Provider Hetzner (CapH)
            * using yaook on top to implement OpenStack
                * putting SCS Cluster Stacks (with CapO) on top
                    * putting production workloads on top
    * Presentation requested (Lightning talk)

### SCS zuul
* If we want to make this our standard tool for pipelined jobs (build, CI, vuln scanning, SBOMs, ...), we need to start treating it as a production tool ...
    * Redundancy (zookeeper cluster)
    * Backups
    * Monitoring (alerting is already implemented)
    * Underlaying infrastructure quality (currently gx-scs)
* We aim to put resources into it to make it production-ready and to deploy more build pipelines on it
    * Should be a first point of artifacts for CSPs
    * Main source for SBOMs from SCS artifacts

### SBOM strategy
* syft and ORT toolkit (zuul integration) to collect supply chain data
    * [SBOM generation](https://goharbor.io/docs/edge/administration/sbom-integration/) (in addition to(?) trivy [integration](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/19458)) being [integrated](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/19130) in harbor
* ORT for evaluating the results (license, security, ...)
* CSPs reusage or (a) artifacts and (b) pipelines?
* How does this benefit / compete / complement / enhance fit into existing SBOM efforts?
