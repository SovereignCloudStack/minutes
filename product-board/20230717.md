## Agenda

### Infra cleanup scripts tracked in [osism/#589](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/589)
* Historical script has been revamped
* ... and extended already (rotate loadbalancers - amphorae)
    * Target first results for 5.3.0, lightning talk wanted

### OSISM 5.3.0 / SCS 5.3.0
* Fix date: 2023-08-30 (Wed)
* Keep overhead small (create tag and push as soon as it's officially released)
* Announce a few days in advance via mail
    * Pre-announce via discussions (matrix)
    * Final announce via feed subscription (to osism/release repo)

### Product Board organizatin / structure
* Product Board focus and constant participation wanted
    * expect participants that can't make it to excuse
    * good preparation needed (@fkr to support)
    * keep p-b group / mailing list up to date

### XFSC Container Registry
Can XFSC microservices be hosted in the [SCS container registry](https://registry.scs.community/)?
* GXFS Migrating into Eclipse Foundation -> XFSC
    * Eclipse has no suitable container registry
* We could help out
    * Shows strong connection b/w SCS and XFSC
* Eclipse should be able to have self-sufficient core infra
    * Hint: They could even deploy SCS and get well-automated infra to put harbor on top
    * Us helping out can only be a short-term stop-gap measure
    * Note that the public SCS registry is running stable, but we have no production-grade SLAs
    * AI @berendt, @batistein: Talk to MPlagge on Eclipse strategy re:SCS and re:Registry
