## Agenda

### SCS-5.2.0 out
* Providers have all migrated to it?
* Status? Issues?
    * PS still in roll-out (prod regions are still WIP)
    * All non-prod envs have been updated, looks good thus far
* 5.3.0 with ovn-LB-FIP-HealthMon fixes?
    * Rebuilt stable images
    * Octavia amphorae improvements
    * OVN upgrade?
    * OVN Octavia FIP fix
    * => Target early/mid August (https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/585)

### Wavestack
* Using SONiC now
* Network looks good now -- finally, after lots of issues before
    * https://health.wavestack1.sovereignit.cloud:3000/d/9ltTEmlnk/openstack-health-monitor2?orgId=1&refresh=5m&from=now-2d&to=now
 * OVN @ PS working really well since big ovn upgrade for R4 (5.0.0) 

### Power outage recovery
* Regio.Cloud restored itself after power outage almost automatically
    * Except Octavia amphorae
        * Infamous `PENDING_UPDATE` state
        * Amphorea in ERROR state, needed failover
        * Required database surgery
        * Switch over to other amphorae took time
    * And tiny L8 errors
        * VXLan, ntp drift (important also for OVN)
* Blog article will be written

### Cleanup scripts to search for orphan or errored resources
* Volumes in error state or attached to non-existent instances
* `PENDING_UPDATE` loadbalancer
* Amphorae: Out of space (log files) condition
    * Health-Monitoring (housekeeper) for amphorae incomplete
    * Better monitoring and log rotation wanted (@berendt to create issue)
        * Log rotation: https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/583
        * Monitoring: https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/584
    * Medium-term strategy: Prefer OVN loadbalancing
        * Feature complete enough?
        * Last (?) missing feature in OVN LB: http health-monitor
* Others things in ERROR state ...
* Security group rules
* Nightly scripts wanted to report (and possibly clean-up) this
* Starting point: https://github.com/sapcc/openstack-nannies
    * Focused on database anomalies
    * Want orphan manager
        * E.g. after project deletion
        * Preferrably on API level, fallback to database/process kill/rbd checks
* PS ospurge fork: https://github.com/nerdicbynature/ospurge/commits/main
    * project purge (openstackclient) not (yet?) complete enough
    * https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2010316
* @garloff to open cleanup script tracking issue
