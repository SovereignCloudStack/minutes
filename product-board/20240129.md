## Agenda

### RelEngR6:

#### Big ticket items:
For the items, think about whether
( a) Feature has been incorporated and basically works
( b) Is covered by CI checks (zuul or ...)
( c) Are documented and in rel notes

* ClusterStacks (on OpenStack) greenfield: :white_check_mark:
    * Main components done, not yet user-friendly
    * Needs polish to be marketable
    * Documentation missing on docs page :exclamation:
* ClusterStacks v1->v2 migration: :question:
    * Straight-forward approach would result in a per-cluster cluster-class which is not desirable
    * Customer feedback wanted: via stackXperts (Burda, creditreform), AOV, syself (XFSC) -> @jschoone
        * Informs us also how high we need to aim with the level of sophistication in the migration
    * Two step process: v1 stable R5 -> v1 main (R6?) will bring cluster classes -> v2 cluster stacks
    * Need "something" to ensure v1 -> v2 works smoothly, but unsure whether we want to label it v1 R6, which would bring some maintenance burden (keep v1 maintained until October)
* Central API: :no_entry_sign:
    * not yet for R6
* Status page API: :question:
    * need to track status
* IAM: Keycloak on k3s :question:
    * need more discussion to have nice integration into OSISM
    * otherwise custom playbook (already works)
* IAM: Domain-manager role :question:
    * pending PRs
    * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/384
    * policy file prepared
    * Side-effects to be expected, needs careful review in order to take in into R6, otherwise postpone
* OpenStack Bobcat
    * Fresh deployment: :white_check_mark:
    * Upgrade CI job: :white_check_mark:
    * Upgrade notes still need to be written
* Rabbitmq improvements:
    * Use Quorum Queues, [merged to 2023.2](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/kolla-ansible/+/898543) :white_check_mark:
    * Reliability and performance improvments ([Change on master](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/kolla-ansible/+/900528) is waiting for approval, very low probability to get it in the release) :question:
        * @artificial-inteligence to support @scoopex
* ProxySQL: :white_check_mark:
    * migrate play in place
* SCS-compatible checks in CI: Not yet :no_entry_sign:
* HealthMon (1iter) in CI (or alternatively spawning one VM using a playbook):
    * [test play](https://github.com/osism/testbed/blob/main/environments/openstack/playbook-test.yml) spawns a VM (and accesses it via ssh) :white_check_mark:
    * That is also covered in full refstack test :white_check_mark:
* Monitoring (the infra below https://monitoring.scs.community/)
    * k8s-observability in good state :white_check_mark:
    * Documentation is currently focused on monitoring SCS project infra, needs to be split into generic pieces that applies to SCS CSPs
* Standards: v4 IaaS and V1 KaaS in preparation
