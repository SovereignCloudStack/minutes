## Agenda

### openssl-3.x havoc ahead
* We don't know what it will be, except that it will likely be bad

    - https://blog.desdelinux.net/en/due-to-a-vulnerability-in-openssl-fedora-37-it-was-delayed-two-weeks-it-would-be-arriving-on-November-15/
    - Hitting Nov ~1 ?
    - Impact on SCS may be limited: Ubu 20.04 is using openssl-1.1.x and thus likely not affected

* Prepare by identifying all places that ship/use openssl-3.x and understand what would need to be done to ship patched software

    -> OSISM: OSISM
    -> Container pieces: @garloff
    -> keycloak: @areqate (via @garloff)

* Patching

    -> Rebuild -> v4.1.0 (targetted 2022-11-02)

* Prepare security advisory

    -> AI @garloff

* Test case for image updates :-)
* Patch workstations/laptops!
* Probably 1. November: https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2022-October/000238.html

### R4 outcomes blog post - publish as is?
* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/pull/416

  -> Final feedback by 2022-11-01 EOB, will be posted 2022-11-02

### Focusing on standardization to broaden SCS impact
* Others claiming sovereign infrastructure, trying to equate sovereign -> SCS in people's minds
* Trying to get broader support for SCS standards, e.g. C&H, StackIT, syseleven, Cleura, StackHPC, TSI, OVH, ...
* Will need a lot more writing (IaaS)

    - Networking: North-South via FIPs (IPv4)
    - cloud-init / metadata service
    - flavor metadata (in addition to naming)
    - storage classes?
    - nova, neutron, cinder extensions
    - keystone features (e.g. application credential support)
    - ... and conformance tests

* Will need a lot of standardization work (IAM, CaaS)

    - Federation
    - cluster-parameters + REST and k8s cluster properties

-> Step by step

-> Communication push early 2023

* Monitoring network?

-> is useful

-> broadening wanted

### Focus on enabling clean domain admin role
* Needs upstream work (which is underway, but needs significant push / speed-up)

-> has high priority

### KaaS strategy
* Self-Service clusters vs. Large Scale KaaS offerings

    - One Ref Implementation may not cover both?
    - (But maybe one set of standards does?)

-> Try to keep standards covering both

-> Gardener may implement SCS standards and be the implementation for large scale

-> Ref. Impl. could then focus on smaller self-service setups

### Mercedes FOSS-Convention
* Kurt invited to present (30mins) on SCS

    - Focus on Open Operations?

* Nominate more invitees?

-> @berendt (via mplagge)

-> @alexander-diab (via @garloff)
