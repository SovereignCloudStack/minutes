## Agenda

### Location of ADRs, Standards, Machine-Representations of Standards, Conformance Tests
* Designs, Standards, ADRs move from Docs to standards
* Same for Conformance Tests and machine-readable pieces that are needed to implement or to validate standards
-> this should stay together and should be migrated to the new standards repo
* What remains in Docs?
* @maxwolfs takes the topic into SIG-Documentation

### Why so much focus on standards?
* Enable non-Ref-Impl based operators to become SCS compatible (by conforming to the standards)
* A few providers in-line with (to-be-tested) commitments to follow SCS 

### eco:digit project
* Has impact on our product strategy
* Technical proposal will be presented to PB and discussed
* To allow feedback to be incorporated, a slot on Jan 4 will be planned (by @alexander-diab)
