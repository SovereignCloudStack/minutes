## Agenda

### netbox update and update policies
* External vs. internally visible components may have different strategy
* hotfix  -> 4.2.0 version migration @ PS
  - v4.2.0 contains netbox
    * netbox shipped in (pre-?)v4.2.0 was broken
    * changed version in release repo
    * no v4.2.1, because that would mean all images need to be rebuilt
  - confusion around when the v4.2.0 was final
    * the existence of the directory pre-dated v4.2.0, which is hard to understand for consumers of the software
    * tagging unclear
  - context: https://github.com/osism/release/commits/main/4.2.0/base.yml
  - Issue: https://github.com/osism/release/issues/733
* TODOs:
  - need to write down how a release happens
    * https://release.osism.tech/#how-do-you-do-a-release
  - process may need tweaks, e.g. add tags, warnings during pre-release stage
  - documented policies what consumers  can expect from major, minor, patch release
  - open issues against ho-do-you-release and then bring back here as needed

### SCS OSI License
- Licensing strategy expresses preference for copyleft (AGPL/LGPL)
(https://docs.scs.community/community/contribute/license-considerations/)
  * Does not reflect reality of our work well
    - Most Apache-2 (permissive)
    - Some CC-BY-SA-4.0 (weak copyleft)
  * Copyleft attractive for contributors, not attractive for pure consumers
  * Copyleft avoids fragmentation
  * Some companies consider (inbound!) GPL/GPL3/AGPL as no-gos
    - Thank Patrick McHardy!

  * May depend on type of contributions
    - Docs => CC-BY-SA-4.0? (= weak copyleft)
    - Standards and compliance check tools => Permissive?
    - Own coding projects => It depends?

- PB Backlog:
  * Write down updated approach (Feb/Mar)
  * Replace public document  (https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/blob/main/community/contribute/license-considerations.md)

### Cloud-in-a-Box
* There is a customer who wants to buy it
* This changes the way we handle it
  - Separate documentation from testbed
  - CI for it needed (-> SMS Lab @ StackHPC)
* Future vision: Position it as possible official on-ramp for SCS
* ~~Maybe preload w/ Tuxedo HW?~~

### FOSDEM input
- Reinitiate collab with Cleura (@garloff)
  * SCS standards perceived as breaking customers on existing platforms
    - which future standards might, if it can't be avoided
    - which no current standard does(!)
- Bleak outlook on Gardener being freed into external foundation
- Contact to keystone core
- Gaia-X:
  * Need at least one person in Bilbao for Hack#6 participation
  * Technical attributes for services are desirable
  * G-X registry is for demo purposes only, currently closed for new contribs
- Contact to EU politics
  * Need French contributions!
