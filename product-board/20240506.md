## Agenda

### SCS positioning vs alternatives

https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/taking-the-airbus-to-the-ikea-cloud/
* Hyperscalers
    * Startups -> consume all these PaaS building blocks
    * May not care about lock-in (which may get very expensive on the long-term)
    * Marketing programs, support programs for startups
    * Investors prefer this
* VMware, Nutanix
* Proxmox
* Sovereign Infrastructure / SCS
    * Repatriation
        * Economic, regulatory, strategic reasons
        * Products vanishing

-> Blog article draft (AI @garloff, hope for contrib from @scoopex, @bitkeks, @friederikezelke, @fkr, ...)
- Marc/scoopex is very happy to contribute. I have a few more arguments that could be useful in this context.

### VMware -> SCS migration
* https://github.com/osism/osism.github.io/pull/403
    * Merged
    * https://osism.tech/docs/guides/other-guides/migration-guide/vmware-esxi
    * Should be visible in the SCS docs tomorrow
        * Testing wanted (real-world use cases)
            * PS: Customers normally don't want to move -- 1:1 feature parity is not a game you can win
            * stackXperts: Using some commercial v2v tool (Hystax acura) - supports Windows driver injection
            * PS hint for tooling: cloudbase.it/coriolis
* https://github.com/osism/vmware2openstack
    * Covers the simple cases
    * README has to be integrated in the VMware Migration Guide
* Not a live migration thing: Best practice from PS for moving:
    * NOT: Lift&Shift (snapshot transferred)
    * BUT: Setup new env, move over data, switch over
