## Agenda
### R5 release
* [Testing commitments](https://input.scs.community/R5-test-schedule#): Not enough yet
    * Need to capture successful test results
        * Annotate test commitment doc with links to persistent storage
    * Enhance nightly tests with zuul also to k8s-cluster-api-provider
        * The more coverage we get by automated testing the better!
        * Have dNation's zuul fill in temporarily for missing zuul.scs.community short-term until
            * Set up meet Gonicus @o-otte, dNation @matofeder
* [Release highlights](https://input.scs.community/2023-scs-r5-highlights-collection#): Extensive input from Containers, bullets from others
    * Where are details behind the bullets?
        * Will be collected (Wed EOB, IaaS+Ops @fkr/, IAM @garloff)
    * To Do: Needs balancing for main release notes
    * To Do: Distill highest highlights for PR ...
* First feedback
    * Integrators serving many customers want more than 6wks overlap support
    * Fresh deployment of OVN not working? (FAU, stackXperts)
        * Waiting for stackXperts lab reproduction
        * (also add option to testbed to have hyperconverged testbed setup in the future might be able to reproduce this as well)
    * CiaB two issues
        * ceph fail domain
        * bootstrap rgw needs to be after keystone
    * one advisory refstack test failing with OVN, disabled, )
    * nasty issue with a kolla-toolbox (subnet without gateway api, upstream SDK bug, backport to openstack-ansible collection ... )

### Persona for service/KaaS operator
* Proposal: First Draft is provided
* AD strongly proposes a dedicated Managed Kubernetes Operator provider persona, perhaps a second one and not merge with a generic Service operator persona
* Go ahead, create proposal!


### [Components of SCS](https://input.scs.community/SCS-Components#)
* Still pretty much empty
* @garloff to work on this, support very welcome! (@matofeder)
* List should be done differently: Let's start with the functionality and then link the standards that cover the functionality and then describe what technology and why it has been chosen
* Should become part of docs.scs.community
