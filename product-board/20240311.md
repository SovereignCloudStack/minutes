## Agenda

### Skyline and future developments (@fkr & @berendt)
- 5 - 10 Minutes
- We want to discuss future of Skyline and what we (as the SCS community) can do to get more adoption for skyline and assure that skyline has a future
- Lacks a PTL currently
    - Interim PTL could be done by Jens (governance, not core)
- Ask SCS CSPs to contribute (so the base of their work remains solid)
- Reach out to contributors

### R6 Release process

#### Overall impression: Go / No-Go
* Testing: Coverage and engagement
    * CiaB testing
    * CSPs: Only PlusServer
    * Release process improved, enabling smaller steps going forward
        * Will do RCs again
* Reported issues and solutions
    * IaaS:
        * LVM2 issue
        * ovn LB in CiaB
        * Reef as TechPreview
* TODO:
    * SCS certification depending on testing
        * SCS-open, SCS-sovereign levels should include this
    * Test automation (beyond the CI tests done in testbed)
        * More work needs to be done
    * Reach out to other CSPs: How do they validate upgrades?
        * OTC, Cleura, OVH, ...
        * expectation: tempest (common) + additional things around (rallye, custom things, ...)
        * AI @garloff: OTC, AI @fkr: Cleura

#### KaaS (@jschoone)
- Similar situation: Not enough testing
- `k8s-cluster-api-provider` Release Notes finished
- Cluster Stacks
    - the approach works good in general
    - some things we solved with `openstackcli` in the past are still WIP upstream, which is why we don't match the SCS expectations yet, (which is why we still support KaaS v1), e.g.:
        - anti-affinity
        - access to hostId (testability of SCS standard 0214)
        - security group management (will be in next capo v1 release)
    - diskless flavors
- Better than v1 in many ways, but no 100% replacement for v1 yet
- KaaS v2 not yet fulfilling 0214
    - Slow down 0214, making it mandatory later

#### Release notes
* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/pull/16
    * KaaS has a good structure already
    * Please add input from each team (SIGs welcome as well)
    * IaaS:
        * Mention highlights from upstream (OSISM, OpenStack, ...) - cherry-picking/filtering what is relevant to SCS
        * OvS, ovn LTS releases
* OSISM
    * Currently focused on what is needed for upgrade (so people can test)
    * Mentioning new features comes next (this week)

#### Messaging
* Highlights / Outcomes
* What is new or a true advantage of R6?
    * Cluster-Stacks on OpenStack
    * Standardization beyond the SCS ref.impl.
    * [k8s-observability](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability) (v1 is out)
    * Kubernetes on the Control/Data Plane?
        * Extensibility
            * keycloak / Federation (available now)
            * rook (future)
            * observability stack (integration available, will use in future)
* What does that mean?: Overall with Release 6 it becomes apparent that SCS is efficient to operate.

    * To do: Summarize for non-SCS experts

#### Summary
  * Operating cloud providing infrastructure efficiently has been one of the core value propositions of the SCS projects as much as giving control and simple deployments to end users. By continously standardizing more aspects - especially leveraging the standardization efforts beyond the IaaS reference implementation - this has been underlined once more. With the recent developments and the release of the technical preview of Cluster-Stacks supporting OpenStack deployment environments of kubernetes clusters are more simple and efficient to handle. By shifting vertical building blocks such as the identity and access management (IAM) to being run and operated from a kubernetes-backed control plane these aspects are being more standardized as well.


#### Standards
- IaaSv4
    - flavor-manager: Adding properties to existing flavors ([osism #899](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/899))
- KaaS: Standards vs testing (0214)
- KaaS: Standards 0214 vs. KaaSv2 (anti-affinity)

#### Central API
- Technical Preview
    - MVP: Usable, very limited scope
- Call to comment on https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/central-api/pull/4
    - Deadline on PR this Wednesday
- Central API taken to practice in combination with Cluster Stacks
- SIG meeting tomorrow, Tuesday, at 10:05
- Will be mentioned in release notes
