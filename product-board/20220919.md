## Agenda

### Image Metadata
* see mails from Kurt et al from last week:
    - adjust them by Wed?
    - Delay official spec release? 
    - Do we need "Effective by YYYY-MM-DD" statements?
    - Issues against openstack-image-manager (https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager/issues)
    - Specs should point to tools that implement specs -> XXXX-manager (XXXX = flavor, image, ...) --> will/should be merged: https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/317
* specs not visible, thus not on IaaS team, PO, operator radar

TODO:
* Adjust image-manager => set image metadata
* Ensure that standard images are available (and uptodate) in image-manager
  - metadata in image-manager need to reference current images (manual work or future: image-crawler)
  - need to ensure that we can keep our promises (e.g. for replace_frequency=monthly)
    *  Align on an effective date for the image MD spec with operators (target by 2022-10-31)
    * Goal of Continuous certfication requires effective dates
    * Communication: Ensure that everyone is aware of existing and upcoming standards

### Milestones in github - final discussion (either here or in SIG RELEASE)
* no R4 (v5.0.0) milestone yet
* need smaller intermediate milestones?

DECISION:
* Use "RN(vN+1.0.0)" milestones
* Manage in yaml file that syncs it across SCS repos => Eduard
