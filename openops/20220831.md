## Agenda

### Proposal for: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/open-operations-manifesto/issues/6

proposal operational processes: 

```
We share our internal processes for the sake of transparency. We firmly believe that transparency leads to better and more reliable processes. We are convinced that publishing well-documented operational processes offers a great opportunity to gather feedback and inspiration from the wide public. 
 
Likewise, we are convinced that us sharing our operational experiences can be of inspiration and benefit for others. In today's business environment, most companies are facing the same challenges. By sharing knowledge the same way the open source community shares software, a common knowledge base can become a reality, allowing everybody to benefit. 
 
We aim to get away from being a big black box and become a source of shared knowledge. We consider the disclosure of internal processes as an essential step towards this direction.
```

Notes: Discussion about wether to use F/LOSS or 'open source' for referring to the community. Since 'open source' is the term more widely known and does not exclude F/LOSS - in other terms - is the more inclusive one (@cedegi mentioned this), we opted for 'open source community' as of now.
Everyone agrees that this is very good proposal.

Make this available in a well-accessible and structured way. -> #2 We share knowledge https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/open-operations-manifesto/issues/2#issuecomment-1232757017
