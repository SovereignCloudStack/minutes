### Agenda

#### Status Update
* Imprint finding has caused loss of speed
    * OSBA has meanwhile agreed
    * Pending: Newsletter to the OSBA members to find further supporters (AI @friederike)
        * Idea: ChatGPT generated summaries may be a good starting point for German language description
* Open Operations Manifesto is being used already successfully by PlusServer (e.g. in discussions with AOV)

#### How to regain momentum?
* Get support from the industry (sign manifesto)
    * New SCS contributors (dNation, ...) (@garloff, @fkr, @jschoone)
    * OSBA members, use members&products pitch, possibly use @uselessbusinessclown (Christian Schmitz) to support (@fkr, )
    * ALASCA: C&H (@garloff), StackIT (@frosty-geek -> B.Schweizer), ...
    * MBTI (@garloff)
    * Cloudical (OpenOps inspired OSS ClOps platform, Meetup Thu) (@friederike)
    * openAPM.io
    * operate first
* Add it to the SCS onboarding process
    * For new CSPs
    * For new tender package winners / partners
    * For new community members (@maxwolfs)
* Collect list of OpenOps examples / role models
    * Link them, Open Operations Blog (-> next month)
    * Open Operations Health Check? (collaborative, this group)
        * Create check list
        * Need to define owner/chair of the process, dispute handling ("governance")
        * Idea: Using OpenInfra as host for the initiative (@garloff)
* Own github namespace/org? -> YES (done, @garloff)
    * Reuse SCS Infra / Tech
    * Or even simpler https://markdoc.dev/ or [hedgedoc](https://input.scs.community/) (@maxwolfs)
