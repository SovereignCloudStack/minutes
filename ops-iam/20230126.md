## Agenda

### Diving into CloudMon (@master-caster & @fkr)

* Current status, hurdles and challenges
  - gx-scs run cloudmon, VMs visible in gx-scs common project (cloudmon-orchestrator, -service-tester2)
  - service-tester-2 has a number of containers that perform the tests and collect the results
  - scenario 5 is currently implemented as PoC
  - logfiles in object storage
  - to do: measure timings, start with more scenarios
  - stories will be created to sprint planing
  - currently ssh key distribution happens manually, consider creating playbook to use list from github-manager (@osism)

### Zuul for SCS

* installation of head and nodepool are WIP
  - artifacts (ansible playbooks/roles, ...) from OSISM may be reusable -> talk to @osfrickler
  - maybe use k8s operator (which was not yet usable when OSISM did their work) https://opendev.org/zuul/zuul-operator

### Status Page

https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/191
* should go to standards repo
  - (documentation on how the directories in that repo should be used is still TBW)
* please provide feedback!

### Consistency check ("fsck") in OpenStack

* Some singular scripts exist (database entries that are left over, rbd volumes without owner, ovs flow tables, namespaces, leftover ports, ...), typically to clean up orphans, e.g. from deleted projects
* CERN, SAP have some collections
* toolsuite is missing, with defined (high!) quality
* this is different from current openstack swiss-army-knife which interacts with OpenStack on API level, not poking into the internals
  - TODO: Define swiss-army-knife (and document limitations in scope)

### Mysterious container restarts @ Gonicus testbed

* Redownloading container image helped in this particular case
* Right approach is to open issue (against osism), with logs, ....
  - Analyzing the issue helps others to see how to analyze and potentially will result in improvements in our code and/or docu and/or test coverage
