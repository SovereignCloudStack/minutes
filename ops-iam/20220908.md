## Agenda

- IAM & Federation 

### IAM Update & Federation

- @reqa presenting his documentation work
  - flow diagram of openstack-cli client with keycloak and keystone
  - should be placed in Docs/Design-Docs
- @reqa will open a PR against Docs/ with his current state of documentation:
  Post-meeting note: done: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/pull/113
- From there it is easier to transform some of the action items to user stories
- It was agreed a workshop is needed to further decide how to design the flow of authentication. This will likely happen on the 11th of October.
  - why was keycloak chosen? Is there an alternative that will make things easier?
    - e.g. zitadel by kaos
  - Outcome of the workshop should be a set of ADRs that outlines the decisions taken

### Status Page

- decided to not do this today, since Dag from C&H has not responded yet and @master-caster (Benjamin) is on vacation
