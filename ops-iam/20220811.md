		* Kurt is debugging existing cluster (team Container) - help wanted => Fri afternoon or Mon overflow
			* Very old cluster (capo-0.3x, k8s-1.18), broke due to cert expiration, half-repaired
			* Going forward for registry.scs.community:
				* Migrate once (or repair and update in place), then do in-place upgrades going forward
			* Learn how to avoid / deal with cert expiration
			* Mirroring onto 2nd instance is a good HA approach (if you don't want to have HA database and repliacted object store)
		* Own container registry is a common desire from DevOps teams
			* Shared multi-tenant instance from provider (docker hub like) - TODO: use SCS keycloak as IdP
			* Private instance for customers with permission models and user ID federation
			=> Kurt to invite Joshua, Vadim, Tim (and openly all interested)
