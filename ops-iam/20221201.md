## Agenda

### Status Page

* Authorization flow / thoughts (@joshmue)
  - Joshua elaborated, no remarks

* Discussion regarding further development (@fkr)
  - wether to align development with others (example: OTC)
  - or does it make sense to define a standard API for status pages and build a reference implementation
    - this would be the "SCS way of doing things"
Â  - @joshmue and @fkr will see that the elaboration of @joshmue regarding the levels of consensus are mailed out to scs-tech for others to read


### How to proceed with CloudMon (@master-caster and @fkr)
*  Discussion regarding the use of Swift by CloudMon, Benjamin will work on the automation of the inital CloudMon Deployment
