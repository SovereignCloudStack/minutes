## Agenda

### Moving from R3 to R4 cycle
https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AOps+milestone%3A%22R3+%28v4.0.0%29%22
=> OVN Issues marked as R3, discussion on wether to move them to R4 or R5.

@garloff raises the point, that in the past, this was something vital for the Operators so that if they need it, we should see that we deliver this as R4 and not just move it to R5.
We should talk to PCO, since they are heavy OVN user.
