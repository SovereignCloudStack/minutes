## Agenda

### Keycloack / Federation

* hack-session in last week's edition of SIG-IAM
* Web-SSO Browser flow worked between PCO and Wavestack
* testbed cert expired a few months ago
  * [Issue 1296](https://github.com/osism/testbed/issues/1296)

* temporarily switch to LE
* [Documentation written by @req](https://input.osb-alliance.de/p/2022-scs-sig-iam)
  * should be converted into real documentation (user story needed -> @fkr)
    * [Issue 16](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/160)

* Foundation for federation with openstack cli has been laid out
  * the operator side of things
  * Further things to test
    * Tuesday 1600?

* SAML vs. OIDC
  * OIDC more relevant in the scope of gaia-x (SSI/DID bridge)
  * however SAML (especially for example with an ADFS around) still very present, important to allow company IdPs, may possibly even 
    make keycloak-to-keycloak easier (as we may not require the client to process a redirect)

* Minutes of SIG-IAM will be persisted in github as well

### Status-Page

* gonicus on this subject
* [Status of Cachet](https://github.com/CachetHQ/Cachet/issues/4326): Not (well) maintained
* [Another project to look at:](https://github.com/dNationCloud/kubernetes-monitoring)
* Finalize decision-making matrix in order to see weather to extend an existing project or do greenfield 
  -> gonicus

### OpenStack Health Monitor

* due to a real-life problem with a k8s cluster api cluster

### OVN

* Dockerfile has been built
* Ansible part still needs to be written
* needs to be upstreamed properly
