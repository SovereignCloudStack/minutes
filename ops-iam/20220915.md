## Agenda

### Items from issue/51 ("other items to be discussed in Team OPS & IAM")

From @berendt:
* https://github.com/prymitive/karma as alternative for Alerta?
    - Might be a good option, please have a look
    - On-call function, not currently part of the considered status page feature set

* Dead-man switch when alert-mgt is down
    - Reverse pingdom / "dead-man switch": We ping an outside service that creates an alert on missing pings
    - Provided by Atlassian OpsGenie
    - jnull: external service via icinga2: health check for prometheus 
    - kuma-uptime?
    -> LATER

From @joshmue / @master-caster:
* Status-Page
* Comparison of existing solutions: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/blob/main/Decisions/status-page-comparison.md
    - Main trouble is OSS healthiness of existing solutions
    - If only trouble is missing activity our contribution can make it active
    - CachetHQ is the primary candidate from a technical perspective
    * Has been inactive for some time
    * Technical stack with PHP, not meant to be used in a IaC way
    - Creating from scratch are estimated to be smaller if we add up all the integration and adjustment into various SCS environments, estimated << 1 person year, more predictable than forking/extending
    - Next steps:
    * Define mandatory feature set vs. nice-to-have features
    - Talk to Operators (@itrich to support @master-caster), nextcloud form
    * Sketch architecture

Proposal from @fkr: Use the deep dive next week for decision on wether to extend something existing or build something from scratch / greenfield. 
Matrix from @master-caster: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/blob/main/Decisions/status-page-comparison.md

From @joshmue:
* IAM, Use of Machine Identities for Service Authentication
* Authorizing machines to access services without distributing tokens/secrets
    - Machines have identities, can have roles like "can access container registry", "can write to object storage", ...
    - Simplifies operations and security
    - Machines identify themselves via one id that they have received ("passport")
* Create ADR
    - @joshmue, @juanPTM to work on this, support from @reqa, @garloff, @matfechner

From @jnull:
    * IAM discussion & workshop in WaveCon with zitadel (Oct 11) with univention/osba as well
