## Agenda

### Halfway towards R4

#### SCS is continously built and tested
* OSBA bought resources from wavecon for getting infra access for testing (zuul), now waiting for set up
* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/157,
- was refined by @o-otte and @fkr, stories ready being worked on
* Plan is to use roles from OSISM for deployment

#### Federation
* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/25
* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/191
* https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystoneauth/+/869876
* Patch submitted for device flow authentication, zuul complaining about PEP8 violations, needs some work
- Idea: Set up pylint github action to avoid PEP8 complaints in the future
* Blog post on this is WIP: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website/pull/493
* Again trouble with certificate acceptance in testbed (some flags changed?)
- @reqa to work through this with @matfechner (SIG IAM), reopen issue if it's a real issue
* https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/209 can be closed

* keycloak still the default in R4?
- ansible role already has been deprecated in OSISM
- IdM Broker to be deployed on manager-provided k8s
- keycloak not used by betacloud, pco, wavestack
- it's not working well yet
- not on PCO's roadmap (sticking to local users for the next ~6 months), keycloak is being used successfully in plusserver though
- wavestack using zitadel, betacloud planning for it
- zitadel not supporting device auth flow (yet?)
- we are settling on dev auth flow, we need to work with the zitadel team if we want to decide in favor of zitadel becoming part of the ref impl
- what is the decision process on keycloak vs zitadel?
(1) evaluation needs to happen -> we have started but not completed it
* Start with requirements
(2) decision needs to be taken -> still needs to happen

* Decision taking:
- Writing down expectations and requirements (must haves, nice to haves, ...)
* We should have turned most unknown unknowns into known unknowns by now
* May need a bit more PoC work to do get there
=> Create GH issue to do this
- Evaluate solutions (incl. the community and the ability to influence things) against  requirements
- Write it down in an ADR
- Decision by PO after team discussion

#### Splitting Ops&IAM team meeting into separate meetings?
* Observation is that quite some participants only care about half the topics
-> Will  do this
* Suggestion: Promote SIG IAM to Team IAM, keep Fri 10:05 CE(S)T slot, may need a new IAM hacking slot then
-> Search for better slot (AI @fkr), Fri 10:05 could then remain as the hacking session



#### OpenStack Health Monitor / CloudMon
* Out of time
