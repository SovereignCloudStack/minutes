## Agenda

### container layer within operator docs
* there is still confusion about k8s cluster api provider
* overall architecture picture on introduction page needed
    * https://docs.scs.community/docs/
* would be good to have and introduction text also for the container layer. concept, status quo, interplay with iaas and outlook on clusterstacks
* We need an introduction text for container layer answering the following questions on: https://docs.scs.community/docs/category/container-layer
    * Who is the target group? 
    * What is it not?
    * Prerequisites and Requirements (knowledge, software, hardware)
    * Features, Capabilities and Limitations (k8s cluster api provider only runs on openstack)
        * how does it interact with the iaas layer?
    * current plans on implementations, roadmap and current state on clusterstacks 
        * is it worth it to implement with the outlook on clusterstacks?
        * comparison table of cluster-api-provider and cluster-stacks
        * alpha label might make sense for cluster-stacks to indicate that it's in development
    * Success Stories and Deployment Examples

This will be worked on in this hedgedoc: https://input.scs.community/container-layer-intro-on-docs-page

* @jschoone and @fdobrovolny will take it to Team Container
