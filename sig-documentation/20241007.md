### SCS on OpenDesk

- docs for running on opendesk on scs cluster. [Repo on GitHub](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/opendesk-on-scs)
- question: best place to put app use cases?

  - "running on scs" or "applications on scs" as card on the landing page / additional resources
  - also suitable for future user docs:
    - cloud migration,
    - usage of openrc and application credentials

- AI: @maxwolfs opens PR with implementing user docs with [OpenDesk on SCS Docs](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/opendesk-on-scs)
  - @michaelbayr for review

### Future MGMT of SIG/SCS Docs

- status quo:
  - current state/difficulty of docs adresses primarily new CSPs, but current CSPs are all contributors
- probably to be handled by the future Product Board and best case one responsible board member that is able to manage the different requirements of new and mature CSPs to keep the docs alive
