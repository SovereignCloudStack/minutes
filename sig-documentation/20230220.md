## Agenda

### remove remote content and update gh action

<https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs-page/pull/36>

* will be implemented in javascript as node.js is already present within build process, both locally and during build process

### add edit button that links to external repositories

<https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs-page/issues/38>

* it should also be clear where the content is coming from

### version current docs for upcoming release?

* there is the possiblity of making a snapshot of the current docs and label them as R3
* instead of adding local docs, it would be better to add commit sha to docs.package.json
* but does it make sense to give docs for older versions as everyone should be on the latest version?
* We think no because:
* to have only latest docs seems to be the better approaach. in case of breaking changes: might be better handled within info boxes in corresponding content
* A whole copy would me mean a whole different documentation from DX/UX perspective to choose from
* release-notes indicate breaking changes and general updates
* An area on the landing page for main features of a new release supports understanding
* versioning makes more sense within the individual tools such as the openstack-image-manager
* It is important to ask about this approach in the product board to have a common decision and approach

### Hackathon Session Proposal by SIG Documentation

* currently no topics

### styles: codeblock background too bright

* see styles: <https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/tree/master/src/themes>
* in order to differentiate easier between cli und file codeblocks it makes sense to indicate it in the title within the blockquotes
