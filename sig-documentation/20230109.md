## Agenda

### Side discussion: Work out user journey for both pages (website and docs site). Distinction should be clear and easy

* High level:
  * scs.community: for the outside world
  * docs.scs.community: for our community
* @maxwolfs takes this to the project team

### staging branch

* staging branch from gh-pages, useful for testing larger changes without having a local tool chain: <https://docs-staging.scs.community/>

### Migration of /Docs to /docs-page (PR#)

* Rename Docs to standards and move rest out
* @maxwolfs creates PR to remove redundant files
* Should the content of the /docs-page reside within the /docs-page repo or in an own /docs?
  * people look for /docs, thus this would be good exist, but maybe only a minimal landing page, linking docs.scs.community and the docs-page repo (and possibly more ...)
  * not to be confused with a /docs folder that should exist in most repos ... (as it does in osism/image-manager)

### Cloud in the Box Docs

* main docs should reside within /testbed documentation
  * issues against ciab may be moved over to testbed
  * add a few links from ciab docu to testbed docu (usage, getting started, ...)
