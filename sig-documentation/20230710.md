## Agenda

### Rework OSISM Documentation

- needs to be improved as feedback states several flaws
  - different versions e.g. old screenshots
- it's not 100% clear what the use case is -> should be stated in the beginning

### Rethink SCS Documentation Framework

- Best DX (Developer eXperience) should be the aim
  - Documentation Consumer is the target group
- As SCS contributes to upstream repos, docs should work for individual repos as for the whole SCS project
- one challenge with individual repos/docs are
  - not in ideal/logical order
    - should represent graspable strucutre of scs concept
  - not structured for an easy start
    - people don't know where to start, lack of deployment scenarios and use-cases (hardware, cloud resources,...)
- a refactor to integrated docs would mean a lot of manual editorial work on two spots
- How to proceed with scs org repo docs like k8s-cluster-api-provider?
- Is it better to have an all automated docs sync workflow or keeping up manually with the editorial work?

### @mbay reporting his experience (trying to deploy SCS/OSISM on Bare Metal)

- Documentation drift between SCS docs and current state
- Drift between testbed and bare-metal code/docs
- Lack the user-centric reading guide, overview, red line

### Central Doc proposal

- Needs a team of technical writers to maintain it
  - More editorial work is more manual work, but better quality
  - Easier to contribute to (not so much indirection)
- Maybe two parts
    1. Technical reference documentation (decentralized)
    2. Centralized user-centric doc with introduction, overview, reading guide, ...
- [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) (four categories):
    1.1. Tutorials (Learning-Oriented)
    1.2. How-to-Guides (Task-Oriented)
    2.1. Explanations (Understanding-Oriented)
    2.2. Reference Docs (Information-Oriented)

### Rework documentation structure

- feedback gathered pointed out that the order is misleading
- it should support also bare metal use cases and more intro/examples

#### Status quo structure

### How to Proceed

- discussion on next SIG Docs
