### Stable links within docs-page and standards

- see Issues: [#249](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/249)
  - there is confusion about the standards numeration
  - there should be stable links for all changes to the latest state of standdards and release notes
    - import standards repo like all other docs
      - rewrites with [plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects)
      - needs linting and link checking like /docs repository
      - add /archived directory to standards repository to have all previous states of standards available -> preserves history and transparency
      - if a link/file naming within /standards changes there must be a hint to add a rule to docusaurus config for rewrite to maintain stable links
      - changelog within standard and sha number and no version number in file name?
      - bring topics to next sig-standardization and ask about the current state of discussion
- [Issue #55](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs-page/issues/55)
- possible solution within docs-page via docusaurus plugin: <https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects>

### blog migration from scs.community to docs.scs.community

- is ongoing post per post by @maxwolfs
