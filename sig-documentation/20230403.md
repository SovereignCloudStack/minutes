## Agenda

### Standards Overview

* now online too: <https://docs.scs.community/standards/>
* first proposal for interactive: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs-page/issues/41>
  * It would make sense to have two filters for 1. kubernetes and 2. IaaS versioning
  * There is wild mix of
    * non-certifiable standards like 0001 and 0002 that are not checked within the scs-compatible.yaml
    * Certifiable and scs-compatibale checks
    * Decisions Records (ADR)
  * most important question: What is a standard and what is an internal organisation helper?
  * We need to differentiate SCS standards between:
    * Decisions Records (ADR) -> mainly SCS Developers, but also SCS Operators for understanding and navigating
    * Organisational Standards -> only for SCS Developers
    * Certifiable and scs-compatibale checks -> SCS Operators
  * Maybe we have to step back again and have a look at different personas and how they look at SCS
    * SCS Operator
      * offer SCS stack to their customers and need comaptible standards overview
    * DevOps Employee of SCS Operator
      * need a subset of scs operators
    * SCS Developer/Contributor
      * need organizational standards
  * There could be a dropdown filter for different personas for lowest barrier to understand scs standards
  * First step: only show scs-compatible standards
  * SCS Community knows where to find all the other information
  * We need a readme within the /standards/standards to explicitly show what is happening here and link to the docs.page with overview

### Onboarding Guide for new Companies

* would be a good place for scs organizational standards
* @itrich won't be able to finish the scs contributor playbook
  * <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/265>

### [OSISM Documentation](https://docs.osism.tech/)

* @ra-beer is currently converting it from .rst to .md
* Information from index pages should go into markdown files that reflect its usecase
  * e.g. installation & deployment -> overview.md as it is an overview for whole installation & deployment process

### Update Blog

* @maxwolfs is currently migrating it with low priority from scs.community to docs.scs.community
* each post will get a folder in the future and no inline-html with external dependencies anymore
* @ra-beer is open for helping with conversion
