## Agenda

### Rework Docs of k8s-cluster-api-provider

* needs to be transformed like openstack-image-manager
  * Rename doc -> docs
  * Split up README.md into Overview, Requirements, Quickstart, Configuration, Contribute
* Same needs to be done for Cloud-in-a-Box (rename README.md -> Quickstart)
* Guides how to do this will be restored (PR from @maxwolfs)
  * Directory structure, Linting Rules, Style Guide, ...

### Linting Rules

* [MD024 - Multiple headings with the same content](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md#md024---multiple-headings-with-the-same-content)
  * Would be good to set the parameter `siblings_only`, ~~anchor links may be broken (docusaurus limitation)~~
* Note and Warnings after each other not liked by markdown (MD028)
  * Two excourses indeed may not be ideal from a reading flow perspective
  * Workaround needed? Or add context (normal text) to avoid this?
* @maxwolfs will create PR

### Standards Overview

* <https://input.scs.community/p/McKZb7j1R#/6>
* Develop further and add technical layer
* integrate standards
  * on the 'What?' technical dimension:
* make interactive
  * fast overview for devops-teams for "how to build"
    * filter for versions
    * filter vor layer (iaas,kaas, etc..)
  * [Nice Gaia-X Example](https://docs.gaia-x.eu/framework/)
    * We need a short one sentence explanation why this specific standard is needed (if clicked on one) -- use [Alasca slides](https://scs.community/assets/slides/ALASCA-SCS-Standardization-20230223-af41e2ca261240527c8a98ba6b0a791c473f3785156375679220fcbb9971887d8e35ef1545182368dfac0238956dddd6a92e8a1efc2290f4de7c0a8ba46f949e.pdf) as starting point
  * [Mermaidflow](https://www.mermaidflow.app/)
* We need an unified naming for the technical layers (iaas,paas, ...)
* Get a Figma Pro plan for the SCS team
* AI: Prepare Figma Session / Workshop and invite @maxwolfs

### Further Issues?

* Stable links to important documents (see e.g. discussion on PR [standards/#249](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/249), PR [docs/#17](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/17))
  * Jekyll has shortlinks feature (used for release notes)
  * Either automate this or host a short-link service
    * Avoid using external domains (like bit.ly, but use own domain and ideally reasonable titles)
  * Docusaurus has stable links as well, can we just cover all relevant pieces there?
    * Or next.js?
  * CI is insufficient, as there are external sites and slides referencing important docs
    * Should still have this for our own sake to prevent broken links on our own turf
      * @itrich already working on it
