### Edit Button Issue

- [issue 104](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/issues/104) and [issue 158](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/issues/158)
- There is a "Edit this page" button on every page of the docs page
- It does only work with the files within the [docs repository](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs) but not with the <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/blob/main/docs.package.json>
- In order to make the edit button work with linking to the correct source file to make changes, it is required to construct the correct edit url during build either in this <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/blob/main/getDocs.js> or a new one

- there are several ways to tackle it:

  - redirects
  - another postinstall script
  - docusaurus plugin

- creating a docusaurus plugin with reading the docs.package.json seems to be the proper way
- then [ejecting](https://docusaurus.io/docs/swizzling#ejecting) the component (the correct one still to be evaluated) and customized with the correct link (depending also on url)
- place the edit link on the right hand side of the breadcrumbs

### Event calendar on individual team pages

- issue: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/issues/141>
- PR for the individual yaml: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/calendar/pull/256>
- Then it will be possible to have calendar with events for each team/sig on their pages including minutes and important files
- mission statements still have to improve
