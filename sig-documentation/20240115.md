## Agenda

### Components for Architectural Overview on Operator Docs Intro
* topic from: <https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/pull/109>
* Aim: Have one Component with Context of the whole Component structure on:
    * index page: global oberview
    * index layer page: layer context overview
    * index component page: component in color and layer in black/white
* Gives greater context of the project and its components
    * tree view and visualistion
    * having it dynamic supports a fast and easy understanding on the whole project
* make this better and dynamically: https://scs.community/assets/images/201001-SCS-4c-06fe1d5ce5729b4e6bc3ac5190d4dafab09f0374f8e329baeab2b092983a3ea2bc11268e0c783f58f4e991e819375bcf5c6bdc95df977bdea22d145b04f6e934.png
* in the current state it's only the components which are part of scs docs:
    * openstack image manager
    * flavor manager
    * status page
    * k8s cluster api provider / clusterstacks
* AI: @maxwolfs is building react component and data structure

### Adding Global Data to Page Context
* this is the technical requirement to make the previous point possible
* custom data structures that should be available on page context need to be loaded by a custom docusaurus plugin
* AI: @maxwolfs will create it in the same branch as the previous component
