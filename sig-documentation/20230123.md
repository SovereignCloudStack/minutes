* Does standards/operational-docs belong to a better place suchs as docs/?
  * would be nice to make blogposts out of them
  * underlyinng rule proposal: every information that easily outdates should be a blog posts. every other information that will be maintained as up-to-date has to be part of the official documentation
    @itrich and @maxwolfs will take this to their blog session on 31st of january

### docs.scs.community Landing Page

* After general statement different users suchs as Newcomers, Managers, Operators should have a CTA UI element to quickstart
  * Three pages for inidividual quickstart guides to SCS
  * @maxwolfs will PR a proposal

### Community vs Docs on docs.scs.communty

* Move the Contributor files and everything that is related to "How" to /community
* Within /community/ subfolders of knowledge, contributing (code, standards, ..) and so on would make sense
* Within /docs/ everything code related should reside and everything related to "What"

### guide for external repositories

* place it here: contribute/code
@maxwolfs will PR the guide

### landscape diagram

* it makes more sense to have people to contribute first and then implement specific diagrams-as-code visualisation frameworks such as mermaid to standardize contributions.
* nevertheless the c4 model methodology for visualising architecutre makes sense

### make glossary integrated

* cool docusaurus plugin to test: <https://gitlab.grnet.gr/terminology/docusaurus-terminology>
  * @maxwolf will evaluate
