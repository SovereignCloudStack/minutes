* Release Notes
  * https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/blob/feat/RelNotes3/Release-Notes/Release3.md
  * hddtemp clarified? -> Yes: deactivated, but not removed yet
    * TODO: Add to OSISM release notes: Deprecated, deactivated, will be removed
  * Upgrading
    * Both WaveStack and PlusCloud moving to R3 / yoga BEFORE R3 release 👍 
      * OSISM can support (if upgrade procedure is not working, we should fix it - L3, tibeer, jharbott)
      * No commercial support contract Wavecon -> OSISM, thus no standby
      * Proceed as planned
    * yoga upgrade test automation (testbed)  incomplete
      * manual testing has been carried out (successfully)
      * full automation after R3 (with zuul, needs more access, hardware)
    * k8s-capi upgrade test+docu
      * manual testing as well :-(
  * Federation finalization & documentation
    * document design
      * keycloak to keycloak works, needs to be documented
      * Risk: mod_auth in keystone may not process redirect correctly
    * Quarkus - keycloak for R4????
  * No Ubuntu 22.04
    * Incomplete support, not recommended, will be in R4

* Move to milestones "R3 (v4.0.0)", "R4 (v5.0.0)" in SCS project?
  * Discuss => Community SIG? Mailing List?
  * Attach milestones to Epics?
