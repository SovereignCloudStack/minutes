##### Release Notes

<https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/blob/feat/RelNotes3/Release-Notes/Release3.md>

Reference OSISM:

<https://github.com/osism/release/blob/main/notes/4.0.0/NOTES.md>

Deprecations:

* hddtemp does not work with Ubu 22.04 -> remove even without deprecation?
  * IaaS Team should discuss this
  * If it can be avoided (keep it for 20.04, which is still default, only disable for 22.04), we should do so to keep true to our deprecation policy
  * Add to deprecation list for R3 (and mention that it does not work well now already)

Release tagging:

* Keep OSISM as is (OSISM v4.0.0 => SCS R3)
* Move SCS repos to v2(R1)->v3(R2)->v3.5(R3)->v4(R4) ?
  * Not really great. Still confusing until next March ðŸ˜Ÿ
* Resolve through documentation (and SBOM / release-repo)

Communication w.r.t. Ubu 22.04:

* Not default yet, intentionally so, upstream kolla is still on 20.04, so it's better validated
* Is prepared and tested -- new deployers (greenfield deployments) can consider it, talk to us
* Will be default in R4 (hopefully also by kolla then)
