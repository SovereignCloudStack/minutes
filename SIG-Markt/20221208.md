Matthias: Ein wichtiges Thema w√§re die Zertifizierung von Umgebungen

Matthias: An important topic for the market is the certification of environments (which was not on the agenda topics yet)

Alex presents in the community call. 

Structuring a PoC should include a feature list: Testing of
KaaS, CaaS, VMs, 
However, in focus of every PoC should be the central value proposition of interoperability

It was raised, if the value proposition is clear to everybody. That was not the case. 
Is SCS well positioned as a brand? The brand should be found through the value proposition and vice versa. 

Cloud-In-A-Box could help to support PoCs. We agreed, that Cloud-In-A-Box use cases are separate PoCs cases, which require a different handling and processing. 

Before a PoC it should be evaluated with the customer, what is his use case / requirements. What does he intend to do with the software. Along this the PoC should be designed. The SMART query technique could help here. 

It would be good to have tutorials and a sample application. 
Terminfinder could be such an app. We could also provide some of our own Apps like the Statuspages.
