## Agenda

### Cloudmon

@costelter gives an overview of their work on cloudmon
  * swift requirement for cloudmon (initial hurdle)
  * https://github.com/stackmon
  * metrics from statsd are currently missing

Plusserver will continue their work on CloudMon in the next sprint as well

Idea is that once the documentation part is done, @fkr and @costelter will do a session in which @fkr tries to bootstrap cloudmon based on the documentation. 

initial test should do (basically what openstack health monitor does)
 * create networks
 * create router
 * create security group
 * spawn instance
