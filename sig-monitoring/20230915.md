### Observability for KaaS and possible integration

* Big question is how to integrate KaaS Observability into the other SCS Observabiltiy stack -> For this we need more input from the IaaS Team
* Idea to have a common Obervabiltiy Kubernetes cluster
* AI @matofeder looking at IaaS Observabiltiy and get in touch with @fkr and @artificial-intelligence on info on the current stack
* @matofeder give overview about how their monitoring Helm Chart are set up
    * Onboarding new Clusters in currently not automated, but documented
    * Discussed how it can be probably integrated with Cluster Stacks to include the tools on the workload cluster
    * @matofeder will investigate how automation to onboard customer cluster can be done
* @o-otte will create a first draft of an ADR
