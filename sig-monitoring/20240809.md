## Agenda

### SCS monitoring

- Instance running at https://monitoring.scs.community had some issues with underlying infrastructure (k8s cluster/etcd db)
    - Issues have been resolved (by the container team) and underlying k8s cluster upgrated to the flavor with the local storage
    - After the upgrade we observe some issues with Grafana and Loki too 
        - Grafana UI: `Template variable service failed NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.`
        - Loki: `status 500 "too many unhealthy instances in the ring"`
    - AI @matofeder: create an issue and try to debug issues next week
