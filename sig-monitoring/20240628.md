## Agenda

### eco:digit onboarding into observability stack (@bitkeks)

* Josefine from the [eco:digit](https://ecodigit.de/en/home) project is looking into the observability stack - short demo by @matofeder
* Background: ecodigit provides a test bench for cloud systems, creating digital twins of real clusters. Example: customer plans a workload to run on a SCS-cluster and wants to measure power impact. The defined cluster can be put into the test bench and a resource consumption calculation is simulated
    * Reading metrics is central for this effort, CPUs, memory, network etc.
    * Have an SCS OCP cloud for testing deep dive
    * Power consumption framework for bare metal and VMs: (https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre)
    * Kubernetes: Kepler (https://sustainable-computing.io)
* [Docs for SCS observer cluster](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/blob/ded44feafd212d72bce29cae86e46d5bf0acdbe0/docs/scs-deployment.md)
    * Resource limitations of the test cluster are a topic to look at
* SCS observability cluster and frameworks like Scaphandre look like a good fit, so we'll collaborate where possible and useful


### Loki was deployed at https://monitoring.scs.community (@matofeder)
- Loki simple scalable deployment (SSD) mode is used - This mode can scale up to a few TBs of logs per day, https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/get-started/deployment-modes/#simple-scalable
- see updated arch diagram of SCS deployment https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/blob/main/docs/scs-deployment.md#architecture
- several follow-up issues have been opened:
    - Enhance Authentication for Loki API Endpoint - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/issues/61
    - Enable Loki deployment by default - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/issues/59
    - Enable Promtail Agents in the "SCS Harbor Cluster" - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/issues/62
    - Enable grafana explore feature for the anonymous access - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/issues/63
    - Improve docs - https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/issues/60
