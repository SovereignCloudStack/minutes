## Agenda

* let's have a talk about how to generate sensible and discernible node-names in prometheus/grafana. 
  because kolla generates scrape configs by IP endpoints = grafana dashboards are filled with IPs.
  
   - Proposal: Generate a Document which outlines how to use overlay files for prometheus (detail out deep merge from 
     prometheus.yml.d for custom subscrapes) and show example prometheus.yml to overrule the generation of kolla default scrape jobs (IP based) with our desired form of scrape (fqdn based)

     this is possible thanks to OSISM rolling out /etc/hosts and the prometheus-server container mounting this file - no dns server needed. [issue-162](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/162)
