## Agenda

### Alerting of Zuul problems (@bitkeks)

- May be the wrong meeting, but after yesterday's filling up of Zuul disk, the Zuul instance on zuul.scs.community went to 502 unavailable state
    - Are there enough alerts for SCS infrastructure? -- For disk, yes
    - Another thing that came to light: the "shorten URL" feature in Grafana creates a wrong URL, http and port 3000. @matofeder will look into it, if necessary

### Enable Loki on monitoring.scs.community (@bitkeks)

- *Agenda point put on out of curiosity, can we have a look at the workflow?*
- Request by @jschoone to export Cluster Stacks Kubernetes logs to SCS Prometheus
- Task tracked in issue [k8s-observability/issues/50](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability/issues/50) and work is being done by @matofeder
- Workflow: 
    1. promtail (as log shipping agent) picks up logs from VMs
    2. push to Loki (as log aggregation service)
    3. Grafana can query Loki to display graphs (no UI in loki)
- Loki query language, use lables like in Prom
- Comparison to ELK stack
- We have a general look into dashboards and the observability stack
