## Agenda

### IaaS Monitoring: Current plan and beyond (@matofeder)

- https://input.scs.community/hLb9RRQ1QKKGPfLvd2dGTw?view
- We discuss the deployment of observability in IaaS, why there are two Prometheus/Thanos instances (one in Ansible setup, one in k3s)
    - We aim to unify the two instances into one, the k3s-based one
